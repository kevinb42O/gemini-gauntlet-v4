# Armor Plate Animation Fix - UPDATED

## Latest Problem (Fixed)
When applying armor plates (pressing R key), the plate was being applied but the animation wasn't playing at all.

## Previous Problem (Already Fixed)
When applying armor plates (pressing C key), the plate animation was being interrupted by movement animations (walk/sprint). This made the animation look janky and inconsistent.

## Root Cause
The `PlayApplyPlateAnimation()` method was directly playing the animation without going through the state machine. Meanwhile, the `Update()` method's `UpdateMovementAnimations()` and `UpdateFlightAnimations()` were continuously monitoring input and overriding the plate animation.

## Solution
Integrated the armor plate animation into the state machine with proper priority protection:

### 1. Added ArmorPlate State (Priority 15)
- Added `ArmorPlate = 15` to the `HandAnimationState` enum
- Positioned between `Beam (14)` and `Emote (16)` in priority
- This gives it higher priority than all movement animations

### 2. Updated PlayApplyPlateAnimation()
**Before:**
```csharp
// Directly played animation without state machine
rightAnim.CrossFade(rightApplyPlateClip.name, crossFadeDuration, 0, 0f);
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Set state BEFORE playing animation
_rightHandState.currentState = HandAnimationState.ArmorPlate;
_rightHandState.stateStartTime = Time.time;

// Then play animation
rightAnim.CrossFade(rightApplyPlateClip.name, crossFadeDuration, 0, 0f);
```

### 3. Protected from Movement Animation Overrides
Added checks in `UpdateMovementAnimations()`:
```csharp
// Skip movement animation updates if armor plate is being applied (MUST NOT BE INTERRUPTED)
if (_rightHandState.currentState == HandAnimationState.ArmorPlate) return;
```

### 4. Protected from Flight Animation Overrides
Added checks in `UpdateFlightAnimations()`:
```csharp
// Skip flight animation updates if armor plate is being applied (MUST NOT BE INTERRUPTED)
if (_rightHandState.currentState == HandAnimationState.ArmorPlate) return;
```

### 5. Updated State Validation
Modified `ValidateAndCorrectStates()` to exclude ArmorPlate from auto-correction:
```csharp
if (_rightHandState.currentState != HandAnimationState.Idle && 
    _rightHandState.currentState != HandAnimationState.Beam &&
    _rightHandState.currentState != HandAnimationState.Emote &&
    _rightHandState.currentState != HandAnimationState.ArmorPlate)
```

### 6. Proper State Cleanup
Updated `ReturnToIdleAfterPlateAnimation()` to properly clear state:
```csharp
// Clear the ArmorPlate state and return to idle
_rightHandState.currentState = HandAnimationState.Idle;
_rightHandState.stateStartTime = Time.time;
```

## Result
✅ **Armor plate animation now plays completely without interruption**
- Movement input (WASD) won't override the animation
- Sprint input (Shift) won't override the animation
- Flight input won't override the animation
- Jump input won't override the animation
- Only Beam and Emote animations can interrupt (by design, higher priority)

## Latest Fix (2025-10-09)

### Root Cause: Circular Call Bug
`PlayerAnimationStateManager.RequestArmorPlate()` was calling `armorPlateSystem.TryApplyPlatesFromInventory()`, which then called `RequestArmorPlate()` again, creating infinite recursion!

### Solution Applied
Modified `PlayerAnimationStateManager.RequestArmorPlate()` to ONLY trigger the animation, not call the plate system:

**Before:**
```csharp
public bool RequestArmorPlate()
{
    // ...
    armorPlateSystem.TryApplyPlatesFromInventory(); // ❌ CIRCULAR CALL!
    // ...
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
public bool RequestArmorPlate()
{
    // ...
    // ONLY trigger the animation - do NOT call ArmorPlateSystem
    if (handAnimationController != null)
    {
        handAnimationController.PlayApplyPlateAnimation(); // ✅ Direct animation call
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Call Flow (Fixed)
1. Player presses **R key** (Controls.ArmorPlate)
2. `ArmorPlateSystem.Update()` detects key press
3. Calls `TryApplyPlatesFromInventory()`
4. Starts `ApplyPlatesSequence()` coroutine
5. For each plate, calls `animationStateManager.RequestArmorPlate()`
6. `RequestArmorPlate()` triggers animation via `handAnimationController.PlayApplyPlateAnimation()`
7. ✅ No more circular calls!

## Files Modified
- `Assets/scripts/HandAnimationController.cs` (previous fix)
- `Assets/scripts/PlayerAnimationStateManager.cs` (latest fix - removed circular call)

## Testing
1. Press **R** to apply armor plates (key changed from C to R)
2. Animation should now play for each plate applied
3. While animation is playing, try:
   - Moving (WASD)
   - Sprinting (Shift + WASD)
   - Jumping (Space)
   - Flying (if unlocked)
4. Animation should complete without interruption
5. After animation completes, movement animations should resume normally

## Key Binding
- **Armor Plate Key**: R (defined in Controls.ArmorPlate)
- Changing the key in Controls.cs or InputSettings will work automatically - no code changes needed!
