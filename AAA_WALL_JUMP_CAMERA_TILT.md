# 🎥 AAA WALL JUMP CAMERA TILT SYSTEM

## 🎯 The SHINE of Your Game

This system creates **cinematic, dynamic camera tilt** during wall jumps, making your movement feel like **Titanfall 2, Mirror's Edge, and Dying Light** combined.

---

## 🔥 What It Does

When you wall jump, the camera **tilts away from the wall** you're jumping from, creating:
- **Cinematic feel**: Like a movie action sequence
- **Spatial awareness**: You FEEL which direction you're going
- **Weight and momentum**: Camera reacts to your movement
- **AAA polish**: Professional-grade camera work

## 🎮 How It Works

### **The Magic Formula**:
1. **Detect wall jump** → Get wall normal (direction away from wall)
2. **Calculate tilt direction** → Project wall normal onto camera's right vector
3. **Apply dynamic tilt** → Camera rolls away from wall (8-12° tilt)
4. **Add forward pitch** → Subtle forward lean for extra dynamism (3°)
5. **Smooth return** → Camera eases back to neutral over 0.4 seconds

### **The Math**:
```csharp
// If wall is to your right → tilt left (negative angle)
// If wall is to your left → tilt right (positive angle)
float dotRight = Vector3.Dot(wallNormal, cameraRight);
wallJumpTiltTarget = -Mathf.Sign(dotRight) * 10°;
```

## 🎨 The Tilt Curve Explained

The **Animation Curve** controls how tilt intensity changes over time:

```
Time:     0.0s ──────────────► 0.4s
Intensity: 100% ──────────────► 0%
           ╱╲
          ╱  ╲___
         ╱       ╲___
        ╱            ╲___
       ╱                 ╲___
```

**Default Curve**: `EaseInOut(0,1 → 1,0)`
- **Start (0.0s)**: Full tilt (100%) - immediate impact
- **Middle (0.2s)**: Holding tilt (~50%) - sustained feel
- **End (0.4s)**: No tilt (0%) - smooth return

**Customization**:
- **Snappy**: Linear curve (instant on, instant off)
- **Smooth**: EaseInOut (default - best feel)
- **Bouncy**: Custom curve with overshoot at end

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### **System Architecture**:

**1. Detection Phase** (AAAMovementController):
```csharp
// When wall jump executes
PerformWallJump(Vector3 wallNormal)
{
    // ... wall jump physics ...
    
    // Trigger camera tilt
    cameraController.TriggerWallJumpTilt(wallNormal);
}
```

**2. Calculation Phase** (AAACameraController):
```csharp
public void TriggerWallJumpTilt(Vector3 wallNormal)
{
    // Project wall normal onto camera right
    float dotRight = Vector3.Dot(wallNormal, cameraRight);
    
    // Calculate tilt direction (away from wall)
    wallJumpTiltTarget = -Mathf.Sign(dotRight) * maxTiltAngle;
    
    // Start timer
    wallJumpTiltStartTime = Time.time;
}
```

**3. Update Phase** (Every Frame):
```csharp
private void UpdateWallJumpTilt()
{
    // Calculate progress (0 to 1)
    float progress = timeSinceWallJump / duration;
    
    // Apply curve
    float curveValue = tiltCurve.Evaluate(progress);
    
    // Smooth interpolation
    wallJumpTiltAmount = SmoothDamp(current, target * curveValue);
}
```

**4. Application Phase** (Camera Transform):
```csharp
private void ApplyCameraTransform()
{
    // Combine all tilt sources
    float totalRoll = strafeTilt + wallJumpTilt;
    float totalPitch = lookPitch + landingTilt + wallJumpPitch;
    
    // Apply to camera
    transform.localRotation = Quaternion.Euler(totalPitch, 0, totalRoll);
}
```

## 🎯 Integration Points

### **Combines With**:
✅ **Strafe Tilt**: Wall jump tilt ADDS to strafe tilt (no conflict)
✅ **Landing Tilt**: Both pitch sources combine smoothly
✅ **Camera Shake**: Tilt + shake = ultra-dynamic feel
✅ **Head Bob**: All effects layer naturally

### **Priority System**:
- **Strafe Tilt**: Continuous, always active
- **Wall Jump Tilt**: Temporary, 0.4s duration
- **Landing Tilt**: Temporary, spring-based
- **All combine additively** - no fighting!

### **If tilt feels too extreme**:
- Decrease `Wall Jump Max Tilt Angle` to **6-8°**
- Decrease `Wall Jump Max Pitch Angle` to **2°**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"Camera doesn't tilt at all"**
- Check `Enable Wall Jump Tilt` is TRUE
- Verify AAACameraController is on camera GameObject
- Check console for "AAACameraController not found" warning

### **"Tilt goes wrong direction"**
- This is a feature! Tilt goes AWAY from wall
- If it feels backwards, you may be expecting tilt INTO wall
- Try it a few times - the away-from-wall tilt feels more natural

### **"Tilt is too subtle to notice"**
- Increase `Wall Jump Max Tilt Angle` to 15°
- Increase `Wall Jump Tilt Speed` to 35
- Enable `Enable Wall Jump Pitch` for extra effect

### **"Tilt makes me dizzy"**
- Decrease `Wall Jump Max Tilt Angle` to 6°
- Increase `Wall Jump Tilt Duration` to 0.6s (slower)
- Disable `Enable Wall Jump Pitch`

### **"Tilt conflicts with strafe tilt"**
- This shouldn't happen - they ADD together
- Check that both systems are enabled
- Verify no NaN values in console
