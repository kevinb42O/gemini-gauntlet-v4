## üéØ Animation Priority Hierarchy

### **Priority 9: EMOTE** (Highest)
- **Hard Locked** - Cannot be interrupted by anything
- **Blend Time:** 0.4s (Slow, cinematic)
- **Philosophy:** Player expression is sacred
- **Examples:** Emote 1-4
- **Lock Type:** HARD (isLocked = true)

### **Priority 8: ABILITY**
- **Hard Locked** - Critical abilities must complete
- **Blend Time:** 0.2s (Normal)
- **Philosophy:** Powerful abilities require commitment
- **Examples:** ArmorPlate application
- **Lock Type:** HARD (isLocked = true)

### **Priority 7: SHOTGUN**
- **Soft Locked** - Committed attack, but beam can interrupt
- **Blend Time:** 0.0s (INSTANT - Doom Eternal style)
- **Philosophy:** Combat must feel snappy and responsive
- **Examples:** Shotgun fire
- **Lock Type:** SOFT (isSoftLocked = true)

### **Priority 6: BEAM**
- **No Lock** - Can be interrupted by higher priority
- **Blend Time:** 0.1s (Fast)
- **Philosophy:** Continuous combat, but not committed
- **Examples:** Beam loop
- **Lock Type:** None

### **Priority 4: TACTICAL**
- **Soft Locked** - Tactical movement requires commitment
- **Blend Time:** 0.05s (Very Fast)
- **Philosophy:** Slide/Dive feel responsive but deliberate
- **Examples:** Dive, Slide
- **Lock Type:** SOFT (isSoftLocked = true)

### **Priority 3: ONE-SHOT**
- **No Lock** (but must complete naturally)
- **Blend Time:** 0.05s (Very Fast)
- **Philosophy:** Movement actions play fully
- **Examples:** Jump, Land, TakeOff
- **Lock Type:** None (completion handler manages)

### **Priority 2: FLIGHT**
- **No Lock** - Freely interruptible
- **Blend Time:** 0.3s (Smooth movement)
- **Philosophy:** Flight feels fluid and natural
- **Examples:** FlyForward, FlyUp, FlyDown, FlyBoost, Strafing
- **Lock Type:** None

### **Priority 1: LOCOMOTION**
- **No Lock** - Always interruptible
- **Blend Time:** 0.3s (Smooth movement - Apex style)
- **Philosophy:** Ground movement flows seamlessly
- **Examples:** Walk, Sprint
- **Lock Type:** None

### **Priority 0: IDLE**
- **No Lock** - Default state, always interruptible
- **Blend Time:** 0.2s (Normal)
- **Philosophy:** Neutral state, ready for anything
- **Examples:** Idle
- **Lock Type:** None

## üîí Lock Mechanism Explained

### **Hard Lock (isLocked = true)**
**Rules:**
- Cannot be interrupted by ANYTHING
- Only the same animation can re-trigger (e.g., rapid shotgun spam)
- Used for critical abilities that MUST complete
- Applies automatic unlock when animation finishes

**States:**
- Emote (Priority 9)
- ArmorPlate (Priority 8)

**Visual Feedback:** Player knows they're committed to the action

### **Soft Lock (isSoftLocked = true)**
**Rules:**
- Can ONLY be interrupted by HIGHER priority
- Lower and equal priority is rejected
- Used for committed actions with tactical weight
- Applies automatic unlock when animation finishes

**States:**
- Shotgun (Priority 7)
- Dive (Priority 4)
- Slide (Priority 4)

**Visual Feedback:** Action feels committed but can be overridden by abilities

### **No Lock**
**Rules:**
- Can be interrupted by same or higher priority
- Movement states freely blend within their tier
- Natural flow and responsiveness

**States:**
- All locomotion (Priority 0-3)
- Beam (Priority 6)

## ‚ö° Blend Time System

### **Why Variable Blend Times Matter:**
Combat needs to feel INSTANT (Doom Eternal philosophy)
Movement needs to feel SMOOTH (Apex Legends philosophy)

### **Blend Time Configuration:**

| Blend Type | Duration | Use Cases |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| **INSTANT** | 0.0s | Shotgun, combat reactions |
| **VERY_FAST** | 0.05s | Dive, Slide, Jump, critical transitions |
| **FAST** | 0.1s | Beam start, combat-to-movement |
| **NORMAL** | 0.2s | Default transitions |
| **SMOOTH** | 0.3s | Movement-to-movement (walk/sprint/flight) |
| **SLOW** | 0.4s | Emotes, cinematic moments |

### **Context-Aware Blending:**
```csharp
// Movement to movement = SMOOTH (0.3s)
Walk ‚Üí Sprint: 0.3s blend

// Combat to movement = FAST (0.1s)  
Beam ‚Üí Walk: 0.1s blend

// Combat = INSTANT (0.0s)
Shotgun: 0.0s blend (snappy!)

// Emote = SLOW (0.4s)
Emote: 0.4s blend (cinematic polish)
```

## üéÆ Interruption Rules (The Golden Rules)

### **Rule 1: Higher Priority ALWAYS Wins**
```
Shotgun (P7) firing ‚Üí Emote pressed (P9)
‚úÖ Emote interrupts instantly (higher priority)
```

### **Rule 2: Equal Priority Allows Blending (Within Same Tier)**
```
Walk (P1) ‚Üí Sprint (P1)
‚úÖ Smooth transition (same tier, free blending)

FlyUp (P2) ‚Üí FlyForward (P2)
‚úÖ Smooth transition (same tier, free blending)
```

### **Rule 3: Lower Priority Cannot Interrupt**
```
Shotgun (P7) firing ‚Üí Walk input (P1)
‚ùå Walk is rejected (lower priority)
Player must wait for shotgun to complete
```

### **Rule 4: Hard Lock Blocks Everything**
```
Emote (P9, HARD LOCKED) playing ‚Üí Shotgun pressed (P7)
‚ùå Shotgun is rejected (hard lock active)
Exception: Emote can re-trigger itself
```

### **Rule 5: Soft Lock Blocks Equal/Lower Priority**
```
Shotgun (P7, SOFT LOCKED) firing ‚Üí Beam pressed (P6)
‚ùå Beam is rejected (lower priority)

Shotgun (P7, SOFT LOCKED) firing ‚Üí Emote pressed (P9)
‚úÖ Emote interrupts (higher priority)
```

### **Rule 6: One-Shots Complete Naturally**
```
Jump (P3) animation playing ‚Üí Walk input (P1)
‚ùå Walk is rejected until jump completes
Then: Movement system naturally resumes
```

---

## üß† Intelligent State Management

### **Previous State Tracking**
Every transition stores previous state for context-aware blending:
```csharp
handState.previousState = currentState;
handState.currentState = newState;
```

### **Beam Interruption Memory**
If beam is interrupted, it can resume after completion:
```csharp
if (previousState == HandAnimationState.Beam)
{
    handState.beamWasActiveBeforeInterruption = true;
}
```

### **Lock Duration Tracking**
Know exactly how long an animation is locked:
```csharp
handState.lockDuration = clip.length;
```

---

## üé¨ Animation Flow Examples

### **Example 1: Combat ‚Üí Movement**
```
1. Player is walking (P1, no lock)
2. Presses shotgun (P7)
   ‚Üí Shotgun interrupts (higher priority)
   ‚Üí INSTANT blend (0.0s)
   ‚Üí Soft lock applied
3. Player presses W to walk (P1)
   ‚Üí Walk rejected (lower priority, soft locked)
4. Shotgun completes (0.3s later)
   ‚Üí Soft lock removed
   ‚Üí Movement system naturally takes over
   ‚Üí Walk animation resumes with SMOOTH blend (0.3s)
```

**Result:** Shotgun feels snappy, player doesn't feel stuck

### **Example 2: Movement ‚Üí Combat ‚Üí Ability**
```
1. Player is sprinting (P1, no lock)
2. Starts beam (P6)
   ‚Üí Beam interrupts (higher priority)
   ‚Üí FAST blend (0.1s)
   ‚Üí No lock
3. Applies armor plate (P8)
   ‚Üí Plate interrupts beam (higher priority)
   ‚Üí NORMAL blend (0.2s)
   ‚Üí HARD lock applied
   ‚Üí Beam interruption stored
4. Player presses shotgun (P7)
   ‚Üí Shotgun rejected (hard lock)
5. Plate completes (1.5s later)
   ‚Üí Hard lock removed
   ‚Üí Beam resumes automatically
   ‚Üí FAST blend (0.1s)
```

**Result:** Ability feels powerful and committed, beam resume is seamless

### **Example 3: Emote During Combat**
```
1. Player is firing beam (P6, no lock)
2. Presses emote (P9)
   ‚Üí Emote interrupts (highest priority)
   ‚Üí SLOW blend (0.4s, cinematic)
   ‚Üí HARD lock applied
   ‚Üí Beam interruption stored
3. Player tries to shoot (P7)
   ‚Üí Shotgun rejected (hard lock)
4. Player tries to move (P1)
   ‚Üí Movement rejected (hard lock)
5. Emote completes (3.0s later)
   ‚Üí Hard lock removed
   ‚Üí Beam resumes automatically
   ‚Üí FAST blend (0.1s)
```

**Result:** Emote plays fully with polish, beam resumes naturally

### **Example 4: Fluid Movement Blending**
```
1. Player walks (P1)
2. Sprints (P1, same tier)
   ‚Üí Smooth blend (0.3s)
3. Jumps (P3, higher)
   ‚Üí Very fast blend (0.05s)
4. Lands (P3)
   ‚Üí Very fast blend (0.05s)
5. Back to sprint (P1, lower but jump complete)
   ‚Üí Smooth blend (0.3s)
```

**Result:** Movement feels like butter (Apex Legends quality)

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### **Priority Query System**
```csharp
private int GetAnimationPriority(HandAnimationState state)
{
    // Returns numerical priority (0-9)
    // Higher number = Higher priority
}
```

### **Blend Time Intelligence**
```csharp
private float GetBlendTimeForState(HandAnimationState state, HandAnimationState previousState)
{
    // Context-aware blend time
    // Shotgun = INSTANT
    // Movement-to-movement = SMOOTH
    // Combat = FAST
}
```

### **Lock Detection**
```csharp
private bool RequiresHardLock(HandAnimationState state)
{
    return state == HandAnimationState.Emote || 
           state == HandAnimationState.ArmorPlate;
}

private bool RequiresSoftLock(HandAnimationState state)
{
    return state == HandAnimationState.Shotgun || 
           state == HandAnimationState.Dive || 
           state == HandAnimationState.Slide;
}
```

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### **1. Player Agency > System Control**
Player input is king. Never fight the player's intent.

### **2. Responsiveness > Animation Polish**
Combat must feel instant. Movement must feel fluid. Polish second.

### **3. Commitment > Cancellation**
Committed actions (attacks, abilities) have weight and consequences.

### **4. Context > Consistency**
Blend times adapt to context. Combat is instant, movement is smooth.

### **5. Predictability > Complexity**
Simple rules, clear hierarchy. Player understands what will happen.
