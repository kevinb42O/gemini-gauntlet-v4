# ANIMATION SYSTEM - FINAL COMPREHENSIVE FIX

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Double Jump Triggered Dive Animation âœ…
**Fixed:** Removed the manual `SetMovementState(Dive)` call in `StartTacticalDive()`. Auto-detection now handles dive animation based on `isDiving` flag.

### Issue #2: Sprint Playing in Air âœ…
**Fixed:** Added grounded check to Sprint auto-detection:
```csharp
if (energySystem.IsCurrentlySprinting && isGrounded) // Added isGrounded!
```

### Issue #3: Sprint Frequency After Jump âœ…
**Fixed:** Sprint state always re-applies animation offset even if already in Sprint:
```csharp
// For non-sprint states, skip if already in that state
if (wasAlreadyInState && newState != MovementState.Sprint)
    return;
    
// ALWAYS apply offset for Sprint
handAnimator.Play(stateInfo.fullPathHash, BASE_LAYER, _animationTimeOffset);
```

## Current System Architecture

### One-Shot Animations (Jump, Land)
- **Triggered:** Manually by movement systems
- **Duration:** Fixed timer (0.6s for Jump, 0.5s for Land)
- **Blocking:** Auto-detection is blocked during one-shot lock
- **Unlock:** Timer expires OR grounded state changes

### Continuous State Animations (Dive, Slide, Sprint, Walk, Idle)
- **Triggered:** Automatically by state detection every frame
- **Duration:** Maintained while state flag is true
- **Priority Order:** Dive > Slide > Sprint > Walk > Idle

### Auto-Detection Logic (Every Frame)
```
1. Check if one-shot animation is locked â†’ Skip auto-detection
2. Check if recent manual state change â†’ Skip auto-detection for 0.1s
3. Determine target state:
   - IsDiving? â†’ Dive
   - IsSliding && Grounded? â†’ Slide
   - IsSprinting && Grounded? â†’ Sprint
   - HasMovementInput && Grounded? â†’ Walk
   - Otherwise â†’ Idle (after 3s delay)
4. If target != current && allowed â†’ Apply state
```

## Debug Logging Added

Watch console for these messages:

### Dive Detection:
```
"[AUTO-DETECT] IsDiving = TRUE, returning Dive animation"
```

### Jump State:
```
"ðŸš€ [JUMP] ANIMATION TRIGGERED! Lock for 0.6s"
"âš¡ [INSTANT UNLOCK] Jump unlocked - GROUNDED!"
```

### Sprint Resume:
```
"âš¡ [INSTANT SPRINT] Sprint resumed INSTANTLY: Jump â†’ Sprint"
```

### Dive Trigger:
```
"[DIVE DEBUG] X pressed! isSprinting: ..."
"[DIVE DEBUG] STARTING DIVE NOW!"
"[TACTICAL DIVE] Initiated! ... Auto-detection will play Dive animation"
```

## What To Test

### Test 1: Normal Jump
1. Stand still or walk
2. Press Space
3. **Expected:** Jump animation plays, Land animation plays
4. **Check logs:** Should see Jump lock, then unlock on landing
5. **Should NOT see:** "[AUTO-DETECT] IsDiving = TRUE"

### Test 2: Sprint Jump
1. Hold Shift and sprint
2. Press Space to jump
3. **Expected:** Jump animation plays in air
4. Land â†’ Sprint resumes with de-synced arms
5. **Should NOT see:** Sprint animation in air
6. **Should see:** Sprint after landing

### Test 3: Tactical Dive (X Key)
1. Hold Shift and sprint
2. Press X (dive key)
3. **Expected:** Dive animation plays immediately
4. **Check logs:** "[TACTICAL DIVE] Initiated!" then "[AUTO-DETECT] IsDiving = TRUE"
5. Dive animation should maintain until landing

### Test 4: Double Jump During Dive
1. Sprint and press X to dive
2. While airborne in dive, press Space
3. **Expected:** Dive cancels, Jump animation plays
4. **Check logs:** "[DIVE DEBUG] Jump pressed during dive - CANCELING DIVE!"
5. IsDiving should become FALSE
6. Jump animation should play

### Test 5: Dive Land to Sprint
1. Sprint and press X to dive
2. Let it land naturally (don't press Space)
3. **Expected:** Land animation plays, then Sprint resumes
4. **Check:** Arms should stay de-synced (no rocking horse)

## If Dive Still Plays on Normal Jump

Check console logs for:
1. Is "[AUTO-DETECT] IsDiving = TRUE" appearing?
   - If YES: Something is setting `isDiving = true` incorrectly
   - Check: Is X key being triggered somehow? Keyboard ghosting?

2. Is dive trigger logic running?
   - Look for: "[DIVE DEBUG] STARTING DIVE NOW!"
   - If YES: Dive is being started by the input check

3. Is CleanAAACrouch Update() being called correctly?
   - The dive check requires: sprinting + grounded + X key
   - Normal jump is Space, not X

## Key Code Sections

### StartTacticalDive() - NO MANUAL TRIGGER
```csharp
isDiving = true;
// Auto-detection will see this and return Dive state
```

### Auto-Detection Dive Check
```csharp
if (crouchController.IsDiving)
    return PlayerAnimationState.Dive;
```

### Jump One-Shot Lock
```csharp
if (newState == PlayerAnimationState.Jump)
{
    isPlayingOneShotAnimation = true;
    oneShotAnimationEndTime = Time.time + 0.6f;
}
```

### Sprint Grounded Check
```csharp
if (energySystem.IsCurrentlySprinting && isGrounded)
    return PlayerAnimationState.Sprint;
```

## What Changed

1. âœ… Removed manual trigger flags (`diveManuallyTriggered`, `slideManuallyTriggered`)
2. âœ… Simplified auto-detection to directly check state flags
3. âœ… Added grounded checks to Sprint and Slide auto-detection
4. âœ… Removed manual `SetMovementState(Dive)` from `StartTacticalDive()`
5. âœ… Fixed Sprint offset re-application after state transitions
6. âœ… Added comprehensive debug logging

## Expected Behavior Summary

| Action | Animation Expected | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Press Space (grounded) | Jump â†’ Land | One-shot animations |
| Press Space (sprinting) | Jump â†’ Land â†’ Sprint | Sprint resumes after landing |
| Press X (sprinting) | Dive â†’ Land/Sprint | Dive maintained until landing |
| Press Space (during dive) | Dive cancels â†’ Jump | Double jump works |
| Sprint normally | Sprint (de-synced arms) | Offset prevents rocking horse |
| Jump while sprinting | No sprint in air | Grounded check prevents this |

Test these scenarios and report what you see in the console!
