# 🔥 FORGE IN-GAME SETUP GUIDE

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

All scripts have been created and are ready to use. Follow these steps to set up the FORGE cube in your game.

---

## 📦 FILES CREATED

### New Scripts:
- ✅ `Assets/scripts/ForgeCube.cs` - Handles player interaction
- ✅ `Assets/scripts/ForgeUIManager.cs` - Manages UI visibility
- ✅ `Assets/scripts/ForgeManager.cs` - **ENHANCED** with context awareness

---

## 🎯 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create the ForgeCube GameObject

1. **In your game scene**, create a new Cube:
   - Right-click in Hierarchy → 3D Object → Cube
   - Name it: `ForgeCube`

2. **Scale the cube** for your 320-unit player:
   - Transform Scale: `(6.4, 6.4, 6.4)` or `(2, 2, 2)` depending on your preference
   - This makes it visible to your giant player

3. **Position it** where you want the FORGE station:
   - Example: `(0, 3.2, 10)` - at ground level, in front of spawn

---

### Step 2: Add ForgeCube Component

1. **Select the ForgeCube** GameObject
2. **Add Component** → Search for `ForgeCube`
3. **Configure settings**:
   - **Interaction Range**: `16` (scaled for 320-unit player)
   - **Auto Close Distance**: `20` (player walks away threshold)
   - **Glow Color**: Orange `(255, 128, 0)` or your preference
   - **Glow When Nearby**: ✅ Checked

---

### Step 3: Create ForgeUIManager in Scene

1. **Create empty GameObject** in your game scene:
   - Right-click in Hierarchy → Create Empty
   - Name it: `ForgeUIManager`

2. **Add Component** → Search for `ForgeUIManager`

3. **Assign the FORGE UI Panel**:
   - In Inspector, find the `Forge UI Panel` field
   - **Drag your existing FORGE Canvas** into this field
   - This is the same Canvas that has your ForgeManager component

**IMPORTANT**: The FORGE Canvas should:
- Already exist in your scene (from menu implementation)
- Have the ForgeManager component attached
- Be set to **inactive by default** (unchecked in Inspector)

---

### Step 4: Configure FORGE Slots for In-Game Context

**CRITICAL STEP** - This ensures FORGE works identically in-game as in menu:

1. **Find your FORGE Canvas** in the scene hierarchy
2. **Expand to find the FORGE slots**:
   - Look for: `ForgeInputSlot1`, `ForgeInputSlot2`, `ForgeInputSlot3`, `ForgeInputSlot4`
   - Look for: `ForgeOutputSlot`

3. **For EACH FORGE slot** (all 5 slots):
   - Select the slot in hierarchy
   - In Inspector, find the `UnifiedSlot` component
   - Under **"FORGE System"** section:
   - ✅ Check **"Is In Game Context"** = `TRUE`

**Why this matters:**
- Menu FORGE: `isInGameContext = false` (default)
- In-Game FORGE: `isInGameContext = true` (must set manually)
- This controls hover behavior, cognitive integration, and interaction

---

### Step 5: Visual Setup (Optional but Recommended)

#### Create Glowing Material:
1. **Create new Material**:
   - Right-click in Project → Create → Material
   - Name it: `ForgeCubeMaterial`

2. **Configure Material**:
   - Shader: `Standard`
   - Albedo Color: Dark Orange `#FF6600`
   - Metallic: `0.5`
   - Smoothness: `0.8`
   - Emission: ✅ Checked
   - Emission Color: Bright Orange `#FF9933`
   - Emission Intensity: `0.5`

3. **Apply to ForgeCube**:
   - Drag `ForgeCubeMaterial` onto the ForgeCube in scene

## 🎮 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Basic Interaction:
- [ ] Walk near ForgeCube → Cube glows orange
- [ ] Walk near ForgeCube → **Cognitive system** displays: "Press E to use FORGE"
- [ ] Press E → FORGE UI opens
- [ ] Press E → **Inventory UI opens automatically**
- [ ] Press E → Mouse cursor becomes visible
- [ ] Press E → Shooting is disabled
- [ ] Press E again → FORGE UI closes
- [ ] Press E again → **Inventory UI closes automatically**
- [ ] Press E again → Cursor locks, shooting re-enabled
- [ ] Walk away from cube (20+ units) → Both UIs auto-close

### Crafting Flow:
- [ ] Open FORGE UI (Press E near cube)
- [ ] Drag items from inventory into FORGE input slots
- [ ] Valid recipe detected → Craft button appears
- [ ] Click Craft → Progress bar animates (5 seconds)
- [ ] Item appears in output slot
- [ ] Double-click output slot → Item goes to inventory
- [ ] **Cognitive system** displays: "Crafted: [ItemName]"
- [ ] Check inventory → Item is there
- [ ] Check console → "✅ Updated PersistentInventoryManager" message

### Persistence Test:
- [ ] Craft an item in-game
- [ ] Exit to menu
- [ ] Check inventory in menu → Item is still there
- [ ] Return to game → Item persists

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Fill inventory completely
- [ ] Craft item → Double-click output
- [ ] **Cognitive system** displays: "Inventory Full!"
- [ ] Item stays in output slot (can retrieve later)

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "ForgeUIManager not found!"
**Solution**: Make sure you created the ForgeUIManager GameObject in your game scene and added the ForgeUIManager component.

### "forgeUIPanel not assigned!"
**Solution**: In ForgeUIManager Inspector, drag your FORGE Canvas into the "Forge UI Panel" field.

### FORGE UI doesn't open
**Solution**: 
1. Check that the FORGE Canvas is assigned in ForgeUIManager
2. Check that ForgeManager component exists on the Canvas
3. Check Console for error messages

### Cursor doesn't unlock
**Solution**: Make sure PlayerShooterOrchestrator exists in your scene. ForgeCube looks for it automatically.

### Items don't go to inventory
**Solution**: 
1. Check that InventoryManager.Instance exists in game scene
2. Check that PersistentItemInventoryManager.Instance exists
3. Check Console for "Cannot find InventoryManager" errors

### Glow effect doesn't work
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure the cube has a Renderer component
2. Make sure "Glow When Nearby" is checked in ForgeCube Inspector
3. Try creating a material with Emission enabled

## 🎯 WHAT WORKS OUT OF THE BOX

✅ **E-key interaction** - Open/close FORGE UI
✅ **Inventory auto-open** - Inventory UI opens/closes with FORGE automatically
✅ **Cursor management** - Auto unlock/lock
✅ **Shooting control** - Auto disable/enable
✅ **Movement** - Always enabled (can walk away to close)
✅ **Auto-close** - Walks away > 20 units (closes both UIs)
✅ **Visual feedback** - Glow effect when nearby
✅ **🧠 Cognitive system integration** - All messages route through CognitiveEvents
✅ **Player messages** - "Press E to use FORGE", "Crafted: Item x1", "Inventory Full!"
✅ **Context routing** - Game items → Inventory, Menu items → Stash
✅ **Persistence** - Items survive scene transitions
✅ **Null safety** - All external calls protected
✅ **State cleanup** - OnDestroy handlers

---

## 🚀 ADVANCED CONFIGURATION

### Adjust Interaction Range:
```
ForgeCube Inspector:
- Interaction Range: 16 (default for 320-unit player)
- Auto Close Distance: 20 (default)

For smaller/larger ranges:
- Interaction Range: 10-30 (experiment)
- Auto Close Distance: Should be > Interaction Range
```

### Change Glow Color:
```
ForgeCube Inspector:
- Glow Color: RGB (255, 128, 0) = Orange
- Try: RGB (0, 255, 255) = Cyan for different look
```

### Multiple FORGE Stations:
```
1. Duplicate ForgeCube GameObject
2. Position in different locations
3. Each works independently
4. All use the same ForgeManager/UI
```

## 📝 INTEGRATION NOTES

### Compatible Systems:
- ✅ InventoryManager
- ✅ PersistentItemInventoryManager
- ✅ UnifiedSlot (drag/drop)
- ✅ **🧠 CognitiveFeedbackManager_Enhanced** (all messages)
- ✅ **CognitiveEvents** (event system)
- ✅ PlayerShooterOrchestrator (shooting control)
- ✅ AAAMovementController (movement)
- ✅ CelestialDriftController (alt movement)

### 🧠 Cognitive System Integration:
All FORGE interaction messages now route through the **Cognitive Events System**:
- `CognitiveEvents.OnWorldInteraction` - FORGE cube proximity, crafting, errors
- Messages display through `CognitiveFeedbackManager_Enhanced.ShowPersistentMessage()`
- Same system used for inventory hover info
- Consistent, intelligent player feedback

### No Changes Required:
- ❌ Movement system
- ❌ Combat system
- ❌ Save/load system
- ❌ Recipe system
- ❌ Existing FORGE UI
