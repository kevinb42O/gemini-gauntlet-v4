# üåä Wall Jump Impact VFX System - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview
This system creates cinematic ripple effects when the player performs wall jumps, with intensity that scales based on player speed. The effects include:
- **Ripple animations** that emanate from the impact point
- **Fresnel glow** that only appears during the ripple animation
- **Speed-based intensity scaling** (faster impacts = more dramatic effects)
- **Performance-optimized pooling** system
- **Full integration** with your existing MovementConfig system

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Ripple Texture
1. Create or import a ripple texture (black and white pattern)
   - **Recommended**: Circular ripple pattern with multiple concentric rings
   - **Format**: Any texture format, preferably 512x512 or 1024x1024
   - **Usage**: The red channel will control ripple intensity

### Step 2: Setup Material and Prefab
1. **Create Material:**
   - Right-click in Project ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Material
   - Name it `WallJumpRippleMaterial`
   - Set Shader to `Custom/WallJumpRippleEffect`
   - Assign your ripple texture to the `Ripple Texture` slot
   - Adjust `Glow Color` (default: cyan `(0, 0.8, 1, 1)`)

2. **Create Prefab:**
   - Create an empty GameObject
   - Add a `Quad` as child (Create ‚Üí 3D Object ‚Üí Quad)
   - Scale the quad to desired size (recommended: `(100, 100, 1)`)
   - Assign the `WallJumpRippleMaterial` to the quad's Mesh Renderer
   - Set Cast Shadows to `Off` and Receive Shadows to `Off`
   - Save as prefab: `WallJumpRippleEffect`

### Step 3: Setup VFX Manager
1. **Create VFX Manager GameObject:**
   - Create empty GameObject in your scene
   - Name it `WallJumpVFXManager`
   - Add the `WallJumpImpactVFX` script component
   - Assign the `WallJumpRippleEffect` prefab to the `Ripple Effect Prefab` field

2. **Configure Settings:**
   ```
   Max Simultaneous Effects: 8
   Base Duration: 2.0
   Effect Scale: 1.0
   Min Speed Threshold: 300
   Max Intensity Speed: 1500
   Min Intensity: 0.3
   Max Intensity: 1.5
   Surface Offset: 0.01
   ```

### Step 4: Update MovementConfig Asset
Your `MovementConfig.asset` now includes these new settings:
```
=== WALL JUMP IMPACT VFX ===
Enable Wall Jump VFX: ‚úì True
VFX Base Duration: 2.0
VFX Effect Scale: 1.0
VFX Min Speed Threshold: 300
VFX Max Intensity Speed: 1500
VFX Min Intensity: 0.3
VFX Max Intensity: 1.5
```

## üé® Customization Guide

### Shader Properties (Material Inspector)
- **Ripple Scale**: Controls overall ripple size
- **Ripple Speed**: How fast ripples propagate outward
- **Ripple Frequency**: Number of ripple rings
- **Glow Color**: Color of the fresnel glow effect
- **Fresnel Power**: Controls how sharp the edge glow is
- **Glow Intensity**: Overall brightness of the effect
- **Fade In/Out Time**: How quickly effects appear/disappear

### MovementConfig Settings
- **Enable Wall Jump VFX**: Master on/off switch
- **VFX Base Duration**: How long effects last (0.5-5 seconds)
- **VFX Effect Scale**: Size multiplier for ripples (0.1-3x)
- **VFX Min Speed Threshold**: Minimum speed to trigger effect (100-1000)
- **VFX Max Intensity Speed**: Speed for maximum intensity (500-3000)
- **VFX Min/Max Intensity**: Effect intensity range (0-3x)

## üîß Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Object Pooling**: Reuses effect objects to prevent garbage collection
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Effects return to pool when finished
- **Configurable Limits**: Maximum simultaneous effects prevents performance drops
- **Shader Efficiency**: Single-pass shader with minimal texture samples

### Surface Adaptation
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Effects position precisely on wall surface
- **Normal-Based Orientation**: Ripples face outward from wall
- **Z-Fighting Prevention**: Automatic surface offset
- **Multi-Surface Support**: Works on any wall angle or size

### Integration Benefits
- **Config-Driven**: All settings in MovementConfig for easy tuning
- **Debug-Friendly**: Respects existing debug settings
- **Performance-Aware**: Automatic pooling and cleanup
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more effect types

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Effects Appearing
1. Check `WallJumpImpactVFX` GameObject exists in scene
2. Verify `Enable Wall Jump VFX` is checked in MovementConfig
3. Ensure player speed exceeds `VFX Min Speed Threshold`
4. Check prefab assignment in VFX Manager component

### Effects Too Weak/Strong
- Adjust `VFX Min/Max Intensity` in MovementConfig
- Modify `Glow Intensity` in material
- Check `VFX Effect Scale` for size issues

### Performance Issues
- Reduce `Max Simultaneous Effects` (try 4-6)
- Lower `VFX Base Duration` to clear effects faster
- Check for memory leaks (should auto-pool)

### Positioning Problems
- Increase `Surface Search Distance` in VFX Manager
- Adjust `Surface Offset` to prevent z-fighting
- Verify wall colliders have proper normals

## üéØ Usage Tips

### For Best Visual Results
1. **Use high-contrast ripple textures** with clear concentric rings
2. **Match glow color to your game's aesthetic** (neon blue, orange energy, etc.)
3. **Tune speed thresholds** to your game's movement speeds
4. **Test on different wall sizes** - effects scale automatically

### For Performance
1. **Keep max effects around 6-8** for complex scenes
2. **Use power-of-2 texture sizes** (512x512, 1024x1024)
3. **Profile in builds**, not just editor

### For Gameplay Feel
1. **Lower min speed threshold** for more frequent effects
2. **Higher max intensity** for more dramatic fast impacts
3. **Longer duration** for more cinematic feel
4. **Larger scale** for bigger, more visible ripples

## üöÄ Advanced Customization

### Adding Sound Integration
Add this to the VFX trigger in `TriggerImpactEffect()`:
```csharp
// Play impact sound with intensity-based volume
float volume = Mathf.Lerp(0.3f, 1f, normalizedSpeed);
GameSounds.PlayWallJumpImpact(impactPoint, volume);
```

### Multiple Effect Types
- Create different prefabs for different wall materials
- Use `wallCollider.tag` to select appropriate effect
- Scale effects based on wall size using `wallCollider.bounds.size`

### Particle Integration
- Add particle systems to the ripple prefab
- Use same intensity scaling for particle emission
- Combine with existing particle effects for layered visuals
