# 🗡️✨ SWORD REVEAL ANIMATION SYSTEM

**Feature**: Dramatic sword unsheath animation when activating sword mode
**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented and Ready to Animate

## 🎉 MAJOR FIX: October 21, 2025
**SOLVED**: Animation snap-to-idle issue fixed!
- ❌ **Old System**: Hardcoded delays (1.5s, 0.7s) caused premature layer weight reset
- ✅ **New System**: Automatically waits for actual animation completion
- 🎬 **Result**: Your 5-second animations now play fully without snapping!
- 🔧 **Applies to**: ALL animations (Sword Reveal, Sword Attack, Shotgun, Power Attack)

---

## 🎬 WHAT IT DOES

When you press **Backspace** to activate sword mode, the right hand now plays a **sword reveal/unsheath animation**:

### The Sequence:
```
1. Player presses Backspace
   ↓
2. 🔊 Unsheath sound plays (metallic sliding)
   ↓
3. 🗡️ Sword GameObject activates (becomes visible)
   ↓
4. 🎭 Reveal animation plays (hand draws sword)
   ↓
5. ✅ Sword mode active - ready to attack!
```

### Why This Is Awesome:
- **🎬 Cinematic** - Feels professional and polished
- **🔊 Audio Sync** - Sound and animation play together
- **⏱️ Natural Timing** - ~1.5 seconds for full reveal
- **👁️ Visual Feedback** - Clear signal that mode changed

---

## 🛠️ ANIMATOR SETUP

### Step 1: Add Trigger Parameter
In your **Right Hand Animator Controller**:

1. Open Animator window
2. Go to **Parameters** tab
3. Add a **Trigger** parameter:
   - Name: `SwordRevealT`
   - Type: Trigger

### Step 2: Enable Override on Shooting Layer
**CRITICAL**: In your **Right Hand Animator**:

1. Select **Shooting Layer** (Layer 1) in the Layers list
2. Click the **gear icon** ⚙️ on the layer
3. Check ✅ **Override** 
4. This makes the Shooting layer override Base layer (like Emote layer does!)

### Step 3: Create Reveal Animation State
In the **Shooting Layer** (Layer 1):

1. Create new state: **"SwordReveal"**
2. Assign your sword unsheath/reveal animation clip
3. Animation should show:
   - Hand reaching for sword
   - Pulling sword out
   - Sword coming into view
   - Ending in ready position

### Step 4: Add Transition
Create transition from **Any State**:

```
Any State → SwordReveal
├─ Condition: SwordRevealT (trigger)
├─ Transition Duration: ~0.1s (quick)
├─ Exit Time: Unchecked ❌
└─ Interruption Source: None (let it complete)
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Do NOT use Exit Time! The code now automatically waits for the animation to finish.

### Step 5: Animation Timing Recommendations

**Reveal Animation Structure**:
```
0.0s - 0.3s:  Hand moves to sword position
0.3s - 0.8s:  Sword slides out of sheath
0.8s - 1.2s:  Sword comes into view (fully visible)
1.2s - 1.5s:  Hand settles into ready pose
```

**Total Duration**: 🎉 **ANY LENGTH YOU WANT!** The system now automatically detects and waits for your animation to finish!

## 🎵 SOUND SETUP

### In SoundEvents ScriptableObject:

Find the **► COMBAT: Sword** section and assign:

```
Sword Unsheath [Assign your unsheath sound here]
```

### Recommended Sound Settings:

```
Audio Clip:          [Metallic sword slide/draw sound]
Category:            SFX
Volume:              0.8 - 1.0 (prominent but not overpowering)
Pitch:               1.0
Pitch Variation:     0.05 (subtle variation)
Loop:                FALSE
Use 3D Override:     TRUE
Min Distance 3D:     10
Max Distance 3D:     40
Cooldown Time:       0.5 (prevent spam if toggling rapidly)
```

### Sound Design Tips:

**Good Unsheath Sounds**:
- Metal sliding on metal (sheath sound)
- Sharp "shing!" at the end
- ~1-2 seconds duration
- Clear start and end
- Layers: scrape + ring + whoosh

**Avoid**:
- Too long (>3 seconds feels sluggish)
- Too short (<0.5 seconds feels cheap)
- No metallic resonance (needs that "shing!")
- Generic whoosh (not specific to sword draw)

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### Code Flow:

```
PlayerShooterOrchestrator.ToggleSwordMode()
    ↓
IsSwordModeActive = true
    ↓
1. Play unsheath sound (SoundEventsManager.Events.swordUnsheath)
    ↓
2. Stop any active shooting (secondaryHandMechanics.StopStream())
    ↓
3. Activate sword visual (swordVisualGameObject.SetActive(true))
    ↓
4. Trigger reveal animation (rightHand.TriggerSwordReveal())
    ↓
IndividualLayeredHandController.TriggerSwordReveal()
    ↓
- Stops beam if active
- Stops emotes if active
- Forces Shooting layer weight to 1.0
- Sets trigger "SwordRevealT"
- Resets state after 1.5s
```

### Technical Implementation:

**IndividualLayeredHandController.cs** - New Method:
```csharp
public void TriggerSwordReveal()
{
    // Stop conflicting animations
    // Force shooting layer to 1.0
    // Trigger "SwordRevealT"
    // Reset after 1.5 seconds (animation duration)
}
```

**PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs** - Integration:
```csharp
if (IsSwordModeActive) // Entering sword mode
{
    // Play sound
    SoundEventsManager.Events.swordUnsheath.Play3D();
    
    // Activate sword visual
    swordVisualGameObject.SetActive(true);
    
    // Trigger animation
    rightHand.TriggerSwordReveal();
}
```

## 🎨 ANIMATION IDEAS

### Basic Reveal (Simple):
```
Frame 0-10:   Hand at rest
Frame 10-20:  Hand moves to hip/back
Frame 20-40:  Sword pulls out slowly
Frame 40-45:  Sword fully revealed
```

### Dramatic Reveal (Cool):
```
Frame 0-5:    Quick glance down
Frame 5-15:   Hand reaches for sword
Frame 15-25:  Slow dramatic pull
Frame 25-30:  Sword gleams in light
Frame 30-40:  Flourish/spin
Frame 40-45:  Ready pose
```

### Combat Reveal (Fast):
```
Frame 0-5:    Immediate reach
Frame 5-15:   Fast pull
Frame 15-20:  Quick ready position
```

### Stylish Reveal (Anime):
```
Frame 0-10:   Build up (dramatic pause)
Frame 10-12:  FAST pull (motion blur)
Frame 12-15:  Sword trail effect
Frame 15-20:  Sword ring/shimmer
Frame 20-30:  Confident pose
```

## 🔧 CUSTOMIZATION

### Change Reveal Duration

**✅ AUTOMATIC!** Just change your animation clip length in Unity:
- Make your animation 1 second, 5 seconds, or 10 seconds
- The system automatically detects and waits for it to finish
- No code changes needed!

**How it works**: The new `ResetShootingStateWhenAnimationFinishes()` method monitors the animator's `normalizedTime` and waits until the animation is 95% complete before resetting the layer weight.

### Sync Sound with Animation

Add **Animation Event** to your reveal animation:

1. Open reveal animation in Animation window
2. Find the frame where sword is fully visible (~frame 30)
3. Add event: `OnSwordFullyDrawn()`
4. Create method in a sword script:
```csharp
public void OnSwordFullyDrawn()
{
    Debug.Log("Sword is now fully drawn!");
    // Could play additional "ready" sound here
}
```

### Add VFX

In the animation, add events for particle effects:

**Frame 20** (sword starts appearing):
```csharp
public void SpawnSwordTrail()
{
    // Instantiate trail particle effect
}
```

**Frame 30** (sword fully revealed):
```csharp
public void SpawnSwordGleam()
{
    // Flash/gleam particle effect
}
```

## 🎬 ADVANCED FEATURES

### Slow-Motion Reveal

Add dramatic slow-mo during reveal:

```csharp
public void TriggerSwordReveal()
{
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Optional: Slow-motion effect
    StartCoroutine(SlowMotionReveal());
}

private IEnumerator SlowMotionReveal()
{
    float normalTimeScale = Time.timeScale;
    
    // Slow down time for 0.5 seconds
    Time.timeScale = 0.5f;
    yield return new WaitForSecondsRealtime(0.5f);
    
    // Restore normal time
    Time.timeScale = normalTimeScale;
}
```

### Camera Zoom on Reveal

Add cinematic camera focus:

```csharp
public void TriggerSwordReveal()
{
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Zoom camera to hand
    CameraController.Instance?.ZoomToHand(1.5f);
}
```

### Disable Attacks During Reveal

Prevent attacking while animation plays:

**In PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs**:
```csharp
private bool _isRevealingSwitch = false;

private void ToggleSwordMode()
{
    if (IsSwordModeActive)
    {
        _isRevealingSwitch = true;
        
        // ... trigger reveal ...
        
        // Re-enable after animation
        StartCoroutine(EnableSwordAfterReveal(1.5f));
    }
}

private IEnumerator EnableSwordAfterReveal(float delay)
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(delay);
    _isRevealingSwitch = false;
}

private void TriggerSwordAttack()
{
    if (_isRevealingSwitch) return; // Can't attack yet!
    // ... normal attack code ...
}
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Animation doesn't play
**Solution**:
1. Check `SwordRevealT` trigger exists in Animator
2. Verify transition from Any State → SwordReveal exists
3. Check Shooting layer (Layer 1) has the state
4. Enable debug logs to see "SWORD REVEAL ANIMATION TRIGGERED!"

### Problem: Animation plays but sword doesn't appear
**Solution**:
1. Verify `swordVisualGameObject` is assigned in PlayerShooterOrchestrator
2. Check that sword GameObject is initially disabled
3. Ensure sword is NOT controlled by animator (PSO handles visibility)

### Problem: Sound doesn't play
**Solution**:
1. Verify `swordUnsheath` is assigned in SoundEvents
2. Check SoundEventsManager exists in scene
3. Look for Console log: "Playing sword unsheath sound!"
4. Verify audio clip is actually assigned

### Problem: Animation gets interrupted
**Solution**:
1. Check transition settings - Exit Time should be unchecked
2. Interruption Source should be None
3. Increase transition duration from Any State

### Problem: Animation snaps to idle before finishing
**Solution** ✅ FIXED!:
The system now automatically waits for animations to complete. No more hardcoded delays!
- Works with ANY animation length (1s, 5s, 10s+)
- Monitors `normalizedTime` to detect completion
- Applied to ALL animations: Sword Reveal, Sword Attack, Shotgun, etc.

### Problem: Animation too fast/slow
**Solution**:
1. Adjust animation speed in Animator state (Speed parameter)
2. The system will automatically adjust wait time to match
3. Match animation speed to sound duration for best feel

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### 1. **First Frame Visibility**
If sword is invisible at animation start, enable it on first frame:
```csharp
// In ToggleSwordMode, BEFORE triggering animation:
swordVisualGameObject.SetActive(true); // Already doing this! ✅
```

### 2. **Sound + Animation Sync**
Record your animation length, then:
- Pick sound that matches duration
- Or adjust animation speed to match sound
- Sweet spot: 1.0 - 1.5 seconds total

### 3. **Camera Shake**
Add subtle shake when sword fully revealed:
```csharp
// Animation event at reveal peak:
CameraShake.Instance?.Shake(0.2f, 0.1f); // Light shake
```

### 4. **Particle Trail**
Add sword trail as it's being drawn:
- Attach Trail Renderer to sword
- Enable in animation event
- Disable after reveal complete

### 5. **Layered Audio**
Combine multiple sounds:
- Base: Metal slide/scrape
- Mid: Cloth rustle (hand movement)
- Peak: Sharp "shing!" (sword fully out)
