## üîß Critical Setup Steps

### 1. Layers (MUST DO!)
Create these layers in Unity:
- **Walls** - All building walls/obstacles
- **ground** - Your existing ground layer (lowercase is fine!)
- **Player** - Player character
- **Enemy** - Enemy characters

### 2. Assign Layers
- All building walls ‚Üí `Walls` layer
- All floors ‚Üí `ground` layer
- Player GameObject ‚Üí `Player` layer
- Enemy GameObjects ‚Üí `Enemy` layer

### 3. Configure LayerMasks
In enemy inspector:
- `visionBlockingLayers` ‚Üí Select `Walls` ONLY
- `coverLayers` ‚Üí Select `Walls`
- `groundLayers` ‚Üí Select `ground`

### 4. Collider Setup (For Hit Detection)
Enemy needs:
- **Collider** (CapsuleCollider recommended)
  - Radius: 50 (matches player width)
  - Height: 320 (matches player height)
  - Center: (0, 160, 0)
  - Is Trigger: FALSE (must be solid!)
- **Rigidbody** (for physics)
  - Use Gravity: TRUE
  - Freeze Rotation: TRUE
- **CompanionCore** (implements IDamageable)
  - Max Health: Set as desired
  - Layer: `Enemy`

---

## üíÄ Death System

### How It Works
1. Enemy takes damage via `CompanionCore.TakeDamage()`
2. Health decreases
3. When health reaches 0:
   - `OnCompanionDied` event fires
   - Enemy transitions to Dead state
   - NavMesh disabled
   - Rigidbody unfrozen (ragdoll effect)
   - Destroyed after 10 seconds

### Hit Detection
Your player weapon must:
- Raycast and hit enemy collider
- Get `IDamageable` component
- Call `TakeDamage(amount, hitPoint, hitDirection)`

Example:
```csharp
RaycastHit hit;
if (Physics.Raycast(origin, direction, out hit, range))
{
    IDamageable damageable = hit.collider.GetComponent<IDamageable>();
    if (damageable != null)
    {
        damageable.TakeDamage(50f, hit.point, direction);
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Detection
- [ ] Enemy detects you at ~25000 units
- [ ] Enemy doesn't see through walls
- [ ] Console shows "PLAYER DETECTED"
- [ ] Green debug rays when detected

### Test 2: Line of Sight
- [ ] Enemy loses you when you hide behind walls
- [ ] Red debug rays when blocked
- [ ] Console shows "Line of sight blocked"

### Test 3: Combat
- [ ] Enemy shoots when has LOS
- [ ] Enemy stops shooting when LOS blocked
- [ ] Enemy maintains distance (2000-15000 range)
- [ ] Burst fire pattern (2s fire, 1.5s pause)

### Test 4: Hit Detection
- [ ] Shooting enemy flashes red
- [ ] Enemy health decreases
- [ ] Console shows damage amount
- [ ] Enemy dies at 0 health

### Test 5: Death
- [ ] Enemy stops moving when dead
- [ ] Enemy falls over (ragdoll)
- [ ] Enemy destroyed after 10s
- [ ] Console shows "Enemy died!"

### Test 6: Indoor Behavior
- [ ] Enemy moves slower indoors (50% speed)
- [ ] Enemy doesn't jump indoors
- [ ] Console shows "Entered INDOOR area"
- [ ] Smooth hallway movement

## üêõ Common Issues

### "Enemy doesn't detect me"
**Cause:** Detection range too small for your scale
**Fix:** Set `detectionRange = 25000` (already done!)

### "Enemy sees through walls"
**Cause:** Wrong layer mask
**Fix:** Set `visionBlockingLayers` to `Walls` layer ONLY

### "Enemy doesn't take damage"
**Cause:** Missing collider or wrong layer
**Fix:** 
1. Add CapsuleCollider (radius 50, height 320)
2. Set `isTrigger = false`
3. Ensure enemy is on `Enemy` layer
4. Verify weapon raycasts hit the collider

### "Enemy doesn't die"
**Cause:** Health not reaching 0
**Fix:**
1. Check `CompanionCore.maxHealth` value
2. Verify damage amount is sufficient
3. Enable `showDebugInfo` to see health changes
4. Use context menu "Test Kill" to verify death works

### "Enemy moves too fast/slow"
**Cause:** NavMesh speed not scaled
**Fix:** Already set to 400-700 range (scaled for your game)

### "Eye height wrong"
**Cause:** Was set for standard Unity scale (1.8)
**Fix:** Now set to 160 (half of 320 = center mass)

## üìä Scale Conversion Reference

If you need to adjust any values:

| Standard Unity | Your Scale | Multiplier |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| 1.8 (height)  | 320        | ~178x      |
| 0.5 (width)   | 50         | 100x       |
| 10m range     | ~5000      | 500x       |
| 1m distance   | ~500       | 500x       |

**Formula:** `YourValue = StandardValue √ó 500` (approximately)

## ‚úÖ Summary

### What's Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ Detection range scaled to 25000 (was 30)
2. ‚úÖ Eye height scaled to 160 (was 1.8)
3. ‚úÖ Raycast spread scaled to 30 (was 0.3)
4. ‚úÖ Combat distances scaled (2000-15000)
5. ‚úÖ Movement speeds scaled (400-700)
6. ‚úÖ Cover radius scaled to 10000
7. ‚úÖ Sound range scaled to 12000
8. ‚úÖ Ceiling detection scaled to 5000
9. ‚úÖ Hit detection fully implemented
10. ‚úÖ Death system fully implemented

### What You Get:
- Enemies that **actually see you** at proper distances
- Enemies that **respect walls** (no wallhacks)
- Enemies that **take damage** and flash red
- Enemies that **die** when health reaches 0
- Enemies that **move smoothly** indoors
- Enemies that **use cover** tactically
- **AAA-quality behavior** at your game's scale
