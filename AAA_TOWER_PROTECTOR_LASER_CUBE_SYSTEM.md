# üéØ TOWER PROTECTOR LASER CUBE SYSTEM

## Overview
The **Tower Protector Cube** (formerly SkullSpawnerCube) is a deadly laser-shooting guardian that protects capture points. It tracks the player, fires devastating laser beams, and becomes a friendly ally if the platform is captured while it's still alive.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Inspector Settings

### Health System
- **Max Health**: 1000 (default)
  - Adjust based on difficulty
  - 1000 HP = ~20 seconds of sustained fire

### Laser Attack
- **Laser Interval**: 15 seconds
  - Time between attacks
  - Gives player breathing room
  
- **Laser Duration**: 5 seconds
  - How long each attack lasts
  - Balance between threat and fairness
  
- **Damage Per Second**: 50
  - Total damage per attack = 250
  - Adjust for difficulty scaling
  
- **Tracking Speed**: 45¬∞/second
  - How fast cube rotates to face player
  - Lower = easier to dodge
  
- **Aim Prediction**: 0.3
  - 0 = no prediction (easy)
  - 1 = full prediction (very hard)
  - 0.3 = balanced for 900 units/s movement

### Visual Settings
- **Laser Width**: 2 units
- **Laser Max Range**: 2000 units
- **Laser Color**: Red (customizable)
- **Glow Intensity**: 2.0

---

## üéÆ Gameplay Design

### Player Speed Considerations
- **Normal Movement**: ~900 units/second
- **Sprint**: ~1800 units/second
- **Prediction Factor**: 0.3 allows skilled dodging
- **Warning Phase**: 2 seconds to react

### Strategic Depth
1. **Kill Before Capture**: Destroy cube for safety
2. **Capture While Alive**: Keep cube as friendly ally
3. **Risk vs Reward**: Friendly cube provides visual landmark

### Balancing
- **15-second interval**: Enough time to recover/reposition
- **2-second warning**: Fair reaction time
- **5-second duration**: Long enough to be threatening, short enough to survive
- **Prediction**: Makes it challenging but not impossible to dodge

---

## üîó Integration with Platform Capture System

### Setup
1. Drag **SkullSpawnerCube** into scene
2. Position on top of Central Tower
3. In **PlatformCaptureSystem** Inspector:
   - Assign cube to **"Tower Protector Cube"** field

### Behavior
- **During Capture**: Cube attacks normally
- **On Capture Complete**: 
  - If cube is alive ‚Üí `MakeFriendly()` called
  - If cube is dead ‚Üí nothing happens
  - Friendly cube glows green permanently

### Debug Visualization
- **Red line**: Hostile cube connection
- **Green line**: Friendly cube connection
- Visible in Scene view when PlatformCaptureSystem selected

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Fair but Deadly
- **Telegraph**: 2-second warning with color change

- **Threatening**: 250 damage per attack is significant
- **Rewarding**: Keeping it alive grants friendly ally

### Player Agency
- **Choice 1**: Kill it for safety
- **Choice 2**: Capture platform while dodging
- **Risk/Reward**: Friendly cube = visual landmark + bragging rights

### Performance
- Single LineRenderer per cube
- Efficient raycasting
- No particle systems (optional to add)
- Coroutine-based (no Update spam)

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Optional)

---

## üéÆ Player Experience

### First Encounter
1. Player lands on platform
2. Cube starts glowing orange
3. Cube rotates to face player
4. **"OH SHIT!"** moment
5. Laser fires - player dodges or tanks
6. Player learns the pattern

### Mastery
- Skilled players dodge with sprint
- Strategic positioning behind cover
- Quick kills with high DPS weapons
- Risk-taking for friendly cube reward

## üí° Tips for Level Design

### Placement
- **Top of Central Tower**: Classic, visible
- **Platform Edge**: More challenging
- **Multiple Cubes**: Extreme difficulty

### Cover Design
- Add pillars/structures for cover
- Balance open space for movement
- Consider laser range (2000 units)

### Difficulty Scaling
- **Easy**: 1 cube, low damage, slow tracking
- **Medium**: 1 cube, default settings
- **Hard**: 2 cubes, high damage, fast tracking
- **Insane**: 3+ cubes, overlapping attacks

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Laser Beam Not Visible
- Verify **Magic Beam Prefab** is assigned in Inspector
- Check that ArcaneBeamStatic.prefab exists in MagicArsenal folder
- Look for "LaserEmitPoint" child object on cube
- Check console for beam spawn messages

### Beam Looks Wrong
- Try different beam variants (Fire, Lightning, etc.)
- Verify beam prefab has MagicBeamStatic component
- Check beam length setting (default 2000)

### No Damage to Player
- Player must have `PlayerHealth` component
- Player must have "Player" tag
- Check raycast is hitting player collider

### Cube Not Friendly on Capture
- Verify cube assigned in PlatformCaptureSystem
- Check `isFriendly` flag in Inspector
- Ensure cube is alive when capture completes

### Sound Not Playing
- Assign SoundEvents ScriptableObject
- Assign audio clip to `towerLaserShoot`
- Check audio source settings in SoundSystemCore
