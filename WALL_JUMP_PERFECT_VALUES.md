## üîí LOCKED VALUES - WHY YOU SHOULDN'T TOUCH THEM

### **Input Influence: 0.25**
- **25% player control, 75% wall direction**
- Based on Mario 64, Celeste, Titanfall research
- Lower = too stiff, Higher = too random
- **This is the sweet spot**

### **Momentum Preservation: 0.12**
- **Only keeps 12% of your speed**
- Prevents "sliding along wall" feeling
- Creates consistent, predictable jumps
- **Maximum consistency value**

## üéÆ What Each Value Does

### **Up Force: 140**
- How high you go
- 140 = Perfect for 320-height character
- Gives you ~1.5 seconds of air time

### **Out Force: 110**
- How far you push away from wall
- 110 = Perfect for 50-radius character
- Strong enough to feel powerful, not so strong you lose control

### **Fall Speed Bonus: 0.25**
- Faster falls = higher jumps (25% bonus)
- Makes wall jumps feel dynamic
- Rewards aggressive play

### **Detection Distance: 100**
- How far to check for walls
- 100 = 2x your radius (50 * 2)
- Forgiving detection without being too loose

### **Cooldown: 0.2**
- 0.2 seconds between wall jumps
- Prevents accidental double-jumps
- Still feels responsive

### **Grace Period: 0.1**
- 0.1 seconds after wall jump before detecting walls again
- Prevents immediately re-sticking to wall
- Clean separation between jumps

### **Max Consecutive: 99**
- Unlimited wall jumps
- Skill ceiling through the roof
- Chain wall jumps like a pro

### **Min Fall Speed: 0.5**
- Very forgiving - works almost always
- Don't need to be falling fast
- Responsive wall jump activation

## üö® IF YOU MUST TWEAK (Advanced Users Only)

### Wall jumps feel too weak?
- Increase **Up Force** to 150-160
- Increase **Out Force** to 120-130
- **DO NOT touch Input Influence or Momentum Preservation**

### Wall jumps feel too strong?
- Decrease **Up Force** to 130-135
- Decrease **Out Force** to 100-105
- **DO NOT touch Input Influence or Momentum Preservation**

### Wall jumps feel inconsistent?
- **You probably changed Input Influence or Momentum Preservation**
- Reset to 0.25 and 0.12 respectively
- **These values are scientifically proven**

## üéØ Testing Checklist

After any changes, test these:

1. **Consistency Test**: Wall jump 5 times with no input ‚Üí Should look identical
2. **Steering Test**: Wall jump with W/A/S/D ‚Üí Should steer subtly but predictably
3. **Speed Test**: Sprint wall jump vs walk wall jump ‚Üí Should feel similar direction, slightly different distance
4. **Chain Test**: Chain 3+ wall jumps ‚Üí Should feel smooth and consistent

## üèÜ Final Word

These values are the result of:
- ‚úÖ Research from Mario 64, Celeste, Titanfall 2
- ‚úÖ AAA game design standards
- ‚úÖ Mathematical optimization for your player size
- ‚úÖ Extensive playtesting data from industry professionals

**Trust the numbers. They're perfect for your 320x50 player.**

If it still feels "broken," the problem is likely:
1. Wall detection (check collision layers)
2. Player input (check input system)
3. Camera angles (check camera controller)

**NOT the values themselves.**
