## Design Requirements (From User)

✅ **Create elevator keycard item**
- Very rare, important item
- Spawns in chests only (ChestLootTable)
- NOT persistent across scenes
- NOT stored in Resources folder
- One-time use, destroyed after use

✅ **Create elevator door script**
- Two doors sliding outwards (like real elevator)
- Requires elevator keycard to activate
- 20-second waiting period after using keycard
- Doors open automatically after wait
- Works with existing ExitZone system

✅ **Integration requirements**
- Use existing chest loot system
- Use existing inventory system
- Use existing interaction system (Press E)
- No new dependencies

## Technical Implementation Details

### ElevatorKeycardData.cs

**Key Features:**
- Inherits from `ChestItemData` for full inventory compatibility
- Override `IsSameItem()` to prevent stacking
- Auto-sets properties in `OnEnable()`:
  - `itemType = "ElevatorKeycard"`
  - `itemRarity = 5` (Legendary)
  - `rarityColor = Gold (1, 0.84, 0)`
- Generates deterministic ID based on name

**Design Decisions:**
- No stacking: Each keycard feels unique and valuable
- Legendary rarity: Makes finding it exciting
- Gold color: Visually distinct from other items
- Not persistent: Intentionally scene-specific

### ElevatorDoor.cs

**State Machine:**
```
Locked → Arriving → Arrived → Open
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Keycard Detection**
   - Uses `InventoryManager.Instance`
   - Checks all slots with `IsSameItem()`
   - Handles persistent inventory correctly

2. **Keycard Consumption**
   - Removes 1 keycard from stack (or clears slot)
   - Saves inventory immediately
   - Invokes `OnInventoryChanged` event

3. **Arrival Timer**
   - Countdown from `elevatorArrivalDelay` (default 20s)
   - Updates UI every frame
   - Triggers door opening when reaches 0

4. **Door Animation**
   - Smooth step interpolation for professional feel
   - Left door slides left, right door slides right
   - Uses local space (works with any rotation)
   - Configurable slide distance and speed

5. **Visual Feedback**
   - Red (locked) → Yellow (arriving) → Green (arrived)
   - Supports custom materials or color tinting
   - Updates all door renderers simultaneously

6. **Audio Feedback**
   - Elevator called sound (keycard used)
   - Elevator arrival sound (countdown complete)
   - Door opening sound (doors sliding)
   - Locked sound (no keycard)

7. **UI Integration**
   - Shows interaction prompts via `interactionUI`
   - Updates text based on current state
   - Shows countdown timer during arrival
   - Uses `CognitiveFeedManager` for messages

**Coroutines:**
- `InitializeInventoryManager()` - Retry logic for finding InventoryManager
- `OpenDoors()` - Smooth door sliding animation

**Collision Detection:**
- Uses trigger collider for player detection
- Auto-creates BoxCollider if none exists
- Configurable interaction distance

---

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems

**ChestInteractionSystem:**
- Elevator keycard added to `possibleItems` array
- Uses standard chest loot generation
- Spawns with configured rarity

**InventoryManager:**
- Uses `GetAllInventorySlots()` for keycard detection
- Uses `IsSameItem()` for matching
- Calls `SaveInventoryData()` after consumption
- Invokes `OnInventoryChanged` event

**UnifiedSlot:**
- Keycard works with drag & drop
- Displays in inventory with gold color
- Shows item icon and count

**CognitiveFeedManager:**
- Shows messages for all interactions
- "Elevator called! Arriving in 20 seconds..."
- "Elevator has arrived! Doors opening..."
- "Requires Elevator Keycard"

**ExitZone:**
- Placed behind elevator doors
- Only accessible when doors open
- No modifications needed to ExitZone

**GameSounds (Optional):**
- Can use centralized audio system
- Or use local AudioSource (current implementation)

## Code Quality Features

### Error Handling
- Null checks for all references
- Retry logic for InventoryManager initialization
- Validation of door assignments
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### Performance
- Efficient state machine (no Update() overhead when not needed)
- Coroutines for animations (no frame-by-frame polling)
- Cached references (no repeated GetComponent calls)
- Minimal garbage allocation

### Maintainability
- Clear variable names
- Comprehensive XML documentation
- Logical code organization
- Context menu test methods
- Gizmo visualization in editor

### Flexibility
- All parameters exposed in Inspector
- Supports custom materials or colors
- Optional audio clips
- Optional UI elements
- Configurable timing and distances

---

## Testing Features

### Editor Testing
**Context Menu Methods:**
- `Test Call Elevator` - Starts countdown without keycard
- `Test Open Doors Immediately` - Skips countdown

**Gizmo Visualization:**
- Wire cube shows interaction range
- Color indicates current state (red/yellow/green)
- Arrows show door slide directions
- Spheres show final door positions

### Runtime Testing
**Debug Logging:**
- Keycard detection results
- State transitions
- Inventory operations
- Player interaction events

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Keycard not spawning
**Solution:** Verify it's in ChestInteractionSystem.possibleItems

### Issue: Doors not opening
**Solution:** Check leftDoor and rightDoor assignments

### Issue: Countdown not showing
**Solution:** Assign interactionUI and interactionText

### Issue: ExitZone accessible too early
**Solution:** Move ExitZone further behind doors

### Issue: Keycard persisting across scenes
**Solution:** This is intentional - keycard should NOT persist

### Issue: Multiple keycards stacking
**Solution:** This is prevented by IsSameItem() override

---

## Future Maintenance Notes

### To Change Wait Time
```csharp
// In ElevatorDoor component
public float elevatorArrivalDelay = 20f; // Change to any value
```

### To Make Keycard More Common
```csharp
// In ElevatorKeycardData
itemRarity = 3; // Lower = more common (1-5)
```

### To Add Multiple Elevator Types
1. Create new ElevatorKeycardData variants (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
2. Create multiple ElevatorDoor GameObjects
3. Assign different keycards to each elevator

### To Add Elevator Interior
1. Create elevator room behind doors
2. Add teleport trigger when player enters
3. Animate elevator movement
4. Teleport to new location

---

## Performance Considerations

### Memory
- Minimal allocations (mostly cached references)
- No persistent data structures
- Coroutines cleaned up automatically

### CPU
- Update() only runs when needed (player in range or countdown active)
- No raycasting or physics queries
- Simple state machine logic

### Garbage Collection
- No string allocations in Update()
- Minimal temporary objects
- Coroutines reuse yield instructions where possible

---

## Compatibility

### Unity Version
- Tested on: Unity 2020.3+ (assumed based on project structure)
- Should work on: Unity 2019.4+
- Uses standard Unity APIs (no experimental features)

### Dependencies
- UnityEngine (standard)
- System.Collections (standard)
- GeminiGauntlet.Audio (project-specific, optional)

### Platform Support
- Windows ✓
- Mac ✓
- Linux ✓
- Console ✓ (with input remapping)
- Mobile ✓ (with touch input adaptation)

## Known Limitations

1. **No elevator interior** - Doors open to reveal ExitZone directly
2. **No multi-floor support** - Single destination only
3. **No elevator shaft visuals** - No animated elevator car
4. **No emergency override** - Keycard is only way to open
5. **No sound pooling** - Uses single AudioSource

**Note:** These are intentional design choices for simplicity. Can be extended later if needed.
