# üíÄ SKULL SYSTEM SETUP GUIDE

## üî• CLARIFICATION: BOTH ARE FLYING SKULLS!

**I apologize for the confusion in my analysis!** Both skull types fly. Here's the actual difference:

---

## üì¶ YOUR TWO FLYING SKULL TYPES

### **Type 1: SkullEnemy.cs (Tower Skulls)** ‚úÖ ALREADY WORKING

**What is it?**
- Flying skulls spawned by **TowerController** when player enters platform
- Physics-based flight (no gravity)
- Chases player with swooping/circling patterns
- Auto-despawns when too far or after 10 seconds

**Your Status:** ‚úÖ **YOU SAID THESE WORK PERFECTLY - NO SETUP NEEDED!**

**Where they spawn:**
- From towers in your capture-the-platform system
- When player enters platform gravity zone
- TowerController spawns them automatically

---

### **Type 2: FlyingSkullEnemy.cs (World Skulls)** - OPTIONAL

**What is it?**
- Flying skulls that spawn **persistently in the world** (not from towers)
- Same physics-based flight
- Patrols areas, detects player in 360¬∞ radius
- Indoor-optimized with wall/ceiling avoidance

**Your Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROBABLY NOT SET UP** (you'd know if you had these)

**Where they spawn:**
- From **FlyingSkullSpawnManager** (world placement)
- Spawn at level start, persist in area
- For creating "dangerous zones" between platforms

---

## üéØ DO YOU NEED TYPE 2?

Ask yourself:

### ‚ùì Do you want skulls that exist OUTSIDE of tower combat?

**Examples:**
- Skulls guarding a corridor between platforms
- Skulls patrolling a multi-level indoor area
- Persistent skull threats that aren't tied to towers

**If YES:** Set up FlyingSkullEnemy system (see below)  
**If NO:** You're done! Your tower skulls are working perfectly.

---

## ‚úÖ SETUP VALIDATION - Tower Skulls (SkullEnemy.cs)

Since you said tower skulls work, let's verify they're optimized:

### **Required Scene Objects:**

1. **SkullEnemyManager** (Auto-creates if missing)
   - Manages LOD for all skulls
   - Should exist in scene hierarchy
   - **Check:** Look for "SkullEnemyManager" GameObject

2. **SkullDeathManager** (Auto-creates if missing)
   - Batches death effects/audio
   - Prevents freeze when many skulls die
   - **Check:** Look for "SkullDeathManager" GameObject

### **Verify Tower Setup:**

Your TowerController should have:
- ‚úÖ `skullPrefab` assigned in inspector
- ‚úÖ `maxSimultaneousSkulls` set (default 3-5)
- ‚úÖ `skullSpawnInterval` set (default 2-5 seconds)

### **Test It Works:**

1. Enter platform near a tower
2. Tower wakes up
3. Skulls spawn and chase you
4. Skulls glow red when hit ‚úÖ
5. Death VFX plays when killed ‚úÖ
6. No lag when killing 10+ skulls ‚úÖ

**If all work:** Your setup is perfect! üéâ

---

## üöÄ OPTIONAL: Setup Type 2 (World Skulls)

**Only do this if you want persistent world skulls!**

### **Step 1: Create Flying Skull Prefab**

1. **Create Empty GameObject** in scene
2. **Add Components:**
   - Rigidbody (useGravity = OFF, mass = 1)
   - SphereCollider (isTrigger = ON, radius = 1)
   - FlyingSkullEnemy script
3. **Assign Visual Model** (your skull mesh)
4. **Set Layer** to "Enemy"
5. **Drag to Project** to create prefab
6. **Delete from scene**

### **Step 2: Configure Prefab Inspector**

Open your FlyingSkullEnemy prefab:

```
Core Stats:
‚úÖ maxHealth: 30 (bit tankier than tower skulls)
‚úÖ flySpeed: 10
‚úÖ displayName: "Flying Skull"

Detection & Attack:
‚úÖ detectionRadius: 50 (how far it sees player)
‚úÖ attackRange: 3 (when it attacks)
‚úÖ maxChaseRange: 150 (when it gives up chase)

Flying Behavior:
‚úÖ floatAmplitude: 2 (bobbing motion)
‚úÖ erraticMovementIntensity: 0.6 (unpredictable)

Obstacle Avoidance:
‚úÖ wallClearance: 2
‚úÖ groundClearance: 3
‚úÖ ceilingClearance: 2
‚úÖ obstacleLayers: Default + Environment (include walls!)

Effects:
‚úÖ deathEffectPrefab: Your skull death VFX
‚úÖ enableHitGlow: ON
‚úÖ hitGlowIntensity: 1000

Audio:
‚úÖ chatterVolume: 0.6
‚úÖ attackVolume: 0.8
‚úÖ deathVolume: 0.9

PowerUp Drops:
‚úÖ canDropPowerUps: ON
‚úÖ powerUpDropChance: 0.08
‚úÖ powerUpPrefabs: Drag your powerup prefabs here
```

### **Step 3: Add Spawn Manager to Scene**

1. **Create Empty GameObject** named "FlyingSkullSpawnManager"
2. **Add Script:** FlyingSkullSpawnManager
3. **Assign Prefab:** Drag your FlyingSkullEnemy prefab to `flyingSkullPrefab` slot

### **Step 4: Create Level Centers**

Create 3 empty GameObjects for spawn levels:

```
Level1Center (Position: X=0, Y=5, Z=0)
Level2Center (Position: X=0, Y=15, Z=0)
Level3Center (Position: X=0, Y=25, Z=0)
```

Position these where you want skulls to spawn.

### **Step 5: Configure Spawn Manager**

In FlyingSkullSpawnManager inspector:

```
Spawn Levels (3 levels):

Level 0:
  - levelName: "Ground Floor"
  - centerPoint: Level1Center
  - skullCount: 5
  - spawnRadius: 30
  - heightOffset: 0
  - verticalSpread: 3

Level 1:
  - levelName: "Second Floor"
  - centerPoint: Level2Center
  - skullCount: 5
  - spawnRadius: 30
  - heightOffset: 0
  - verticalSpread: 3

Level 2:
  - levelName: "Third Floor"
  - centerPoint: Level3Center
  - skullCount: 5
  - spawnRadius: 30
  - heightOffset: 0
  - verticalSpread: 3

Spacing & Validation:
‚úÖ minSpacing: 10
‚úÖ validateSpawnPositions: ON
‚úÖ obstacleLayers: Default + Environment
‚úÖ spawnCheckRadius: 2

Performance:
‚úÖ parentSkullsToManager: ON
‚úÖ maxAttemptsPerSkull: 50

Visualization:
‚úÖ showGizmos: ON
‚úÖ enableDebugLogs: ON
```

### **Step 6: Visualize Spawn Zones**

1. Select FlyingSkullSpawnManager in hierarchy
2. Look at Scene view
3. You should see:
   - üî¥ Red circle = Level 1 spawn zone
   - üü¢ Green circle = Level 2 spawn zone
   - üîµ Blue circle = Level 3 spawn zone

**Adjust center positions** to place spawns where you want them.

### **Step 7: Test World Skulls**

1. Press Play
2. Watch console for spawn reports:
   ```
   [FlyingSkullSpawnManager] Level 0 (Ground Floor): Spawning 5 skulls
   [FlyingSkullSpawnManager] ‚úÖ Ground Floor: Spawned skull 1/5
   ```
3. Look at scene - skulls should be floating
4. Walk near them - they should detect and chase
5. Kill one - death effects should work

**If skulls clip through walls:**
- Check `obstacleLayers` includes your wall layer
- Increase `wallClearance` to 3-4
- Check walls have colliders

## üî• KEY DIFFERENCES TABLE

| Feature | SkullEnemy (Tower) | FlyingSkullEnemy (World) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Spawned By** | TowerController | FlyingSkullSpawnManager |
| **When** | Player enters platform | Level start (persistent) |

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATION

**Based on your statement that tower skulls work perfectly:**

### ‚úÖ **YOU'RE DONE!**

You have a complete, AAA-optimized skull system for your tower combat. No additional setup needed!

### **Only add FlyingSkullEnemy if you want:**
- Skulls outside of tower areas
- Persistent world threats
- Multi-level indoor areas with skull patrols

**Most games only need Type 1 (tower skulls).** Type 2 is bonus content for creating more dangerous areas.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting Tower Skulls

### **Issue: Skulls not spawning from towers**

**Check:**
1. TowerController has `skullPrefab` assigned
2. Tower has `_skullSpawningEnabled = true`
3. Player is on/near platform (tower wakes up)
4. `maxSimultaneousSkulls` > 0

---

### **Issue: Skulls sink through ground**

**Check:**
1. SkullEnemy inspector: `minGroundClearance = 3`
2. SkullEnemy inspector: `groundLayerMask` includes your floor
3. Floor has collider
4. SkullEnemy inspector: `absoluteMinWorldHeight` is below your world

---

### **Issue: Lag when many skulls die**

**This should NOT happen if SkullDeathManager exists!**

**Check:**
1. Look for "SkullDeathManager" in hierarchy
2. If missing, it should auto-create
3. If still lagging:
   - Select SkullDeathManager
   - Lower `maxDeathEffectsPerFrame` to 2
   - Lower `maxPhysicsOpsPerFrame` to 3

---

### **Issue: Skulls chase player forever**

**Working as designed!** But if you want them to despawn:

**In SkullEnemy.cs:**
- `maxHuntingRange = 300` (give up chase if >300m away)
- `decayDuration = 10` (despawn after 10s of not seeing player)

---

## üéØ FINAL ANSWER

### **Your Question:** "How do I set this up completely?"

**Answer:**

1. **Tower Skulls (SkullEnemy.cs):** ‚úÖ **Already set up and working!**
2. **World Skulls (FlyingSkullEnemy.cs):** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional - only if you want persistent world skulls**

### **Your Confusion:** "They both need to fly! Huh...?"

**Clarification:**

- ‚úÖ **BOTH DO FLY!** I mislabeled them in my analysis
- SkullEnemy = Flying skull from towers
- FlyingSkullEnemy = Flying skull from world spawner
- Both use same flight physics (Rigidbody, no gravity)
- Difference is **where/when they spawn**, not **how they move**

### **What You Should Do:**

**If tower skulls work perfectly: YOU'RE DONE! üéâ**

No additional setup needed. Your skull system is complete and AAA-optimized.

**If you want bonus world skulls:** Follow "Step 1-7" above to add FlyingSkullEnemy system.
