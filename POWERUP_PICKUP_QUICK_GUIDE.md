# ⚡ POWERUP PICKUP - QUICK REFERENCE

## 🎮 HOW IT WORKS NOW

### Method 1: Walk Into It
Just walk into the powerup → **Auto-collects** → Grab animation plays

### Method 2: Press E
Walk near powerup → Press **E key** → Grab animation plays → Collects

---

## 🔧 INSPECTOR SETTINGS

### Per Powerup Configuration
- **Interaction Range**: How close for E key (default: 3 units)
- **Show Interaction Range**: Debug gizmos on/off
- **Enable Collision Pickup**: Walk-through collection (default: ON)
- **Enable Interaction Pickup**: E key collection (default: ON)

---

## 🎨 GIZMO COLORS (Scene View)

- 🔵 **Cyan Circle**: E key interaction range
- 🟢 **Green Circle**: Collision trigger range
- 🟡 **Yellow Line**: Player is nearby
- 🔴 **Red**: Powerup collected

---

## ✅ REQUIREMENTS

### Player Must Have:
- Tag: `"Player"`
- Component: `LayeredHandAnimationController`
- Trigger collider for detection

### Powerup Must Have:
- Trigger collider (isTrigger = true)
- Layer: `"PowerUp"`

## 🎯 QUICK TIPS

**Want collision only?**
- Set `enableInteractionPickup = false`

**Want E key only?**
- Set `enableCollisionPickup = false`

**Adjust pickup distance?**
- Change `interactionRange` value
- Change collider radius for collision range

**Debug not working?**
- Check Player has "Player" tag
- Check collider is trigger
- Enable `showInteractionRange` to see ranges

## 🔥 KEY CHANGES FROM OLD SYSTEM

❌ **REMOVED**: Double-click collection  
✅ **ADDED**: Collision-based pickup  
✅ **ADDED**: E key interaction  
✅ **ADDED**: Grab animation on pickup  
✅ **ADDED**: Player proximity tracking

## 📝 NO CODE CHANGES NEEDED

All individual powerup scripts (AOEPowerUp, MaxHandUpgradePowerUp, etc.) work automatically with the new system. No migration required!

**That's it! Simple, intuitive, and it just works.** 🎉
