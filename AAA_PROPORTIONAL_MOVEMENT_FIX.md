# üéØ PROPORTIONAL MOVEMENT FIX - 320-Unit Character Scale

## üö® THE CORE PROBLEM

Your movement system was **designed for a 75-unit character** and linearly scaled to 320 units. But physics doesn't scale linearly - it scales **quadratically** with size. This created massive proportion mismatches between:

- Jump height vs horizontal travel distance (floaty moon jumps)
- Double jump force vs regular jump (unnoticeable 8-unit lift)
- Wall jump vs ground movement (jarring speed teleports)
- Terminal velocity vs sprint speed (13.4√ó vs realistic 8√ó)
- Slide entry/exit vs sprint speed (105 to 5040 to 1485 chaos)

## ‚úÖ WHAT WAS FIXED

### **1. Jump Physics - Snappier, More Responsive**

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Why Changed |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **jumpForce** | 1900 | **2800** | Jump height was 722 units (2.26√ó height) with 1.52s airtime - felt floaty. Now 1120 units (3.5√ó height) with shorter hang time |
| **gravity** | -2500 | **-3500** | Increased to compensate for higher jumps - faster fall = snappier arcs |
| **doubleJumpForce** | 200 | **1800** | Was 8 units lift (2.5% of height) - **literally unnoticeable!** Now 460 units (1.4√ó height) - feels impactful |

**Physics Math:**
```
Old Jump: height = (1900¬≤)/(2√ó2500) = 722 units = 2.26√ó character height
New Jump: height = (2800¬≤)/(2√ó3500) = 1120 units = 3.5√ó character height

Old Double Jump: (200¬≤)/(2√ó2500) = 8 units = 2.5% of character height ‚ùå
New Double Jump: (1800¬≤)/(2√ó3500) = 460 units = 144% of character height ‚úÖ
```

**Result:** Jumps feel **snappier** - less hang time, more responsive to input, double jump is actually noticeable!

---

### **2. Terminal Velocity - Realistic Fall Speed**

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Ratio to Sprint |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **terminalVelocity** | 20000 | **8000** | Was 13.4√ó sprint, now 5.4√ó sprint |

**Real-World Comparison:**
- Real humans: Terminal velocity = 8√ó running speed
- Your old value: 13.4√ó sprint = rocket physics
- Your new value: 5.4√ó sprint = still fast but feels connected to ground movement

**Result:** Falling feels like **part of the same physics system** as running, not space physics.

---

### **3. Wall Jump Forces - Consistent with Ground Movement**

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Why Changed |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **wallJumpUpForce** | 1400 | **2400** | Was weaker than ground jump (1900) - now 85% of jumpForce for consistent feel |
| **wallJumpOutForce** | 800 | **1200** | Stronger push = clearer wall separation |
| **wallJumpForwardBoost** | 700 | **400** | Less synthetic boost, more player control |
| **wallJumpCameraDirectionBoost** | 1400 | **1800** | Camera intent is the primary control |

**Old Problem:**
```
Ground jump: 1900 up
Wall jump: 1400 up + 800 out + 700 forward + 1400 camera = 2900 horizontal
Result: SLOWER vertically, ZOOM horizontally = jarring speed changes
```

**New Solution:**
```
Ground jump: 2800 up
Wall jump: 2400 up + 1200 out + 400 forward + 1800 camera = 3400 horizontal
Result: Powerful vertical launch, camera controls direction, less synthetic boost
```

**Result:** Wall jumps feel **powerful but consistent** - similar arc to ground jumps, camera aim matters more than WASD.

---

### **4. Slide Speed Alignment - Momentum Continuation**

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Ratio to Sprint (1485) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| **slideMinStartSpeed** | 105 | **960** | Was 7% of sprint ‚ùå Now 65% of sprint ‚úÖ |
| **slideMaxSpeed** | 5040 | **3000** | Was 3.4√ó sprint ‚ùå Now 2√ó sprint ‚úÖ |

**Old Problem:**
```
Sprint: 1485 units/s
‚Üì Crouch to slide
Slide entry: 105 units/s (93% SPEED DROP!)
‚Üì Slide downhill
Slide max: 5040 units/s (240% SPEED BOOST!)
‚Üì Stand up
Sprint: 1485 units/s (70% SPEED DROP!)

Result: Constant speed teleportation, no flow state
```

**New Solution:**
```
Sprint: 1485 units/s
‚Üì Crouch to slide (must be sprinting!)
Slide entry: 960+ units/s (35% speed drop, but momentum-based)
‚Üì Slide downhill
Slide max: 3000 units/s (2√ó sprint - fast but not rocket-mode)
‚Üì Stand up
Sprint: 1485 units/s (smooth transition)

Result: Sliding is momentum continuation, not speed teleport
```

**Result:** Sliding feels like **carrying your momentum forward**, not random speed changes.

---

### **5. High-Speed Detection Threshold - Unified**

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Context |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **highSpeedThreshold** | 350 | **960** | 65% of sprint speed - consistent trigger for high-speed mechanics |
| **HIGH_SPEED_LANDING_THRESHOLD** | 350 | **960** | Now unified with MovementConfig |

**Why 960?**
- Sprint speed = 1485 units/s
- 65% threshold = 960 units/s
- You must be **actively sprinting** to trigger high-speed effects (landing impacts, slide FOV, etc.)
- No more triggering on slow landings

**Result:** High-speed effects trigger when you're **actually going fast**, not randomly.

## üî¨ THE PHYSICS SCALING LAW

**Why Linear Scaling Failed:**

```
Small Character (75 units):
- Forces scale linearly: F = m √ó a
- If you 4√ó the size, you need 16√ó the force (mass scales cubically)
- BUT velocities only need ~2√ó scaling (‚àö of size ratio)

Your Old Approach (WRONG):
75-unit values ‚Üí multiply by 4.27 (320√∑75) ‚Üí apply to everything

Correct Approach:
- Heights: Linear scaling (320 units = 4.27√ó taller)
- Speeds: ~2√ó scaling (‚àö4.27 ‚âà 2.07)
- Forces: ~4√ó scaling for same felt acceleration
- Gravity: Increase to maintain snappy feel at larger scale
```

**Result:** Numbers now feel **proportional** to the world scale.

## üîß IF IT STILL FEELS OFF

### **Jumps Feel Too High/Low:**
```cs
// In MovementConfig.cs
jumpForce = 2800f; // Adjust ¬±200 units

// Rule of thumb: Jump height = (jumpForce¬≤)/(2√ógravity)
// 2800¬≤/(2√ó3500) = 1120 units = 3.5√ó character height
```

### **Jumps Feel Too Floaty/Snappy:**
```cs
// In MovementConfig.cs
gravity = -3500f; // More negative = faster fall = snappier

// -3000 = floatier, more air control
// -4000 = very snappy, less air time
```

### **Slides Start Too Easy/Hard:**
```cs
// In CleanAAACrouch.cs
slideMinStartSpeed = 960f; // Must be sprinting
// 800f = easier entry (54% of sprint)
// 1200f = harder entry (81% of sprint)
```

### **Slides Feel Too Slow/Fast:**
```cs
// In CleanAAACrouch.cs
slideMaxSpeed = 3000f; // 2√ó sprint speed
// 2500f = more controlled
// 4000f = more extreme (but approaching old broken feel)
```

## üéØ SUMMARY

**The Root Cause:** Linear scaling of values designed for small characters (75 units) to large scale (320 units) broke physics proportions.

**The Fix:** Applied **quadratic physics scaling** - forces scale ~4√ó, speeds scale ~2√ó, gravity increased for responsive feel.

**The Result:** Movement now feels **tight, responsive, and proportional** to the 320-unit world scale. Jump heights, speeds, and momentum transitions all work together as one cohesive system.

**Playtest and enjoy your properly scaled movement system!** üéÆ‚ú®
