# 🎯 Slope Jump Surgical Fix - Quick Test Card

## What Was Fixed (DEEP INVESTIGATION)
**Issue:** Super high jumps on slopes - completely inconsistent  
**Root Cause:** Slope descent system adds **3D velocity vector** (X,Y,Z all contaminated)  
- Slope descent: `velocity += slopeDirection * descentPull`
- On 25° slope: `slopeDirection = (0.42, -0.91, 0)` - Y component is the problem!
- Old fix only zeroed `velocity.y = 0` AFTER slope contamination already applied
**Solution:** **SURGICAL Y-AXIS CLEANUP** - zeros Y before jump, preserves horizontal (platform momentum)

## 🧪 Quick Test Protocol

### Test 1: Flat Ground (Baseline)
1. Jump on completely flat surface
2. Note jump height visually (should be ~690 units)
3. **This is your baseline - all other jumps should match this EXACTLY**

### Test 2: Gentle Slope (10-15°)
1. Find gentle slope
2. Jump - should be **IDENTICAL** to flat ground
3. ✅ PASS if same height
4. ❌ FAIL if higher/lower (report console logs)

### Test 3: Medium Slope (25-35°)  
1. Find medium slope
2. Jump - should be **IDENTICAL** to flat ground
3. ✅ PASS if same height (was ~850 units before, should be 690 now)
4. ❌ FAIL if super high jump (old bug still present)

### Test 4: Steep Slope (45°+)
1. Find steepest slope you can walk on
2. Jump - should be **IDENTICAL** to flat ground
3. ✅ PASS if same height (was ~1100 units before, should be 690 now)
4. ❌ FAIL if rocket jump (fix didn't work)

### Test 5: Moving Platform (Flat)
1. Jump on flat moving platform
2. Should inherit platform's horizontal momentum (moves with platform)
3. Jump HEIGHT should still be consistent 690 units
4. ✅ PASS if height consistent but you move with platform
5. ❌ FAIL if platform momentum affects jump height

### Test 6: Moving Platform (Sloped)
1. Jump on sloped moving platform (hardest test!)
2. Should inherit platform horizontal momentum
3. Jump HEIGHT should be **IDENTICAL** to flat ground (690 units)
4. ✅ PASS if consistent height with platform momentum
5. ❌ FAIL if super jump (was ~1300 units before)

## 📊 Debug Logs to Watch

### Good Signs ✅ (Nuclear Fix Working)
```
[JUMP] NUKED slope-contaminated velocity (angle: 25.3°) for 100% consistent jump
[JUMP] Restored clean horizontal velocity: 900.0 units/s in direction (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
[JUMP] NO platform momentum inherited - Pure jump force only: 2200.0 | Slope: 25.3°
[JUMP] Applied 2200.0 jump force, suppressing grounded for 0.31s
```

### Red Flags ❌ (Something Wrong)
- Jump force not 2200.0
- "Platform momentum inherited" message (should say "NO platform momentum")
- velocity.y > 2200 after jump
- Different jump heights on different surfaces

---

## 🎮 What Changed

### Jump Height
**Before:** Varies wildly (690-1300 units depending on slope/platform)  
**After:** **ALWAYS 690 units** everywhere (±0 variation)

### Jump Distance
**Still varies** - sprint jumping goes further (more horizontal distance)  
This is GOOD - you can still control distance, just not height

### Platform Momentum
**Disabled** - jumps don't inherit platform velocity anymore  
This is INTENTIONAL for consistency - can re-enable if needed

## ✅ Expected Results

**ALL surfaces → Exact same jump height (zero variation)**

| Surface Type | Before (Bug) | After (Fixed) | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Flat ground | 690 units | 690 units | ✅ Baseline |
| 10° slope | 750 units | 690 units | ✅ Fixed |
| 25° slope | 850 units | 690 units | ✅ Fixed |
| 45° slope | 1100 units | 690 units | ✅ Fixed |
| Moving platform | 800 units | 690 units | ✅ Fixed |
| Sloped platform | 1300 units | 690 units | ✅ **NUCLEAR FIXED** |

## 🐛 If Still Broken

1. Check Console - look for "NUKED slope-contaminated velocity" message
2. Verify jump force is always 2200.0
3. Verify "NO platform momentum inherited" message appears
4. Check that velocity = (horizontal, 2200, horizontal) after jump

If you still see variation, attach Console logs showing:
- Before jump: velocity values
- During jump: what gets nuked/restored  
- After jump: final velocity

## 🔧 Optional: Re-Enable Platform Momentum

If you want platform momentum back (trades consistency for "realism"):

1. Open `AAAMovementController.cs`
2. Find line ~2236: `// OPTIONAL: Uncomment these blocks...`
3. Uncomment the `if (_currentCelestialPlatform != null)` block
4. Test again - may reintroduce inconsistency on moving slopes!

**Not recommended** - platform momentum was part of the problem.

**Fix Applied:** October 26, 2025  
**Fix Type:** NUCLEAR (complete velocity wipe + pure rebuild)  
**Files Changed:** `AAAMovementController.cs`  
**Testing Priority:** CRITICAL (gamebreaker fix)  
**Expected Outcome:** 100% identical jump heights everywhere
