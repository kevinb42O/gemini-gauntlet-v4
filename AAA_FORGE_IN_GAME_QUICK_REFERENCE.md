## 🛡️ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "ForgeUIManager not found" | Create ForgeUIManager GameObject with script |
| "forgeUIPanel not assigned" | Drag FORGE Canvas to inspector field |
| Items don't persist | Check console for "✅ Updated PersistentInventoryManager" |
| Cursor stays locked | Walk within 16 units of cube (see yellow Gizmo) |
| Shooting doesn't disable | PlayerShooterOrchestrator must exist in scene |

## 💡 Key Concepts

**Context Switching:**
- Menu context → Items go to stash
- Game context → Items go to game inventory

**Persistence Chain:**
```
Game Inventory → inventory_data.json
              ↓
    PersistentItemInventoryManager
              ↓
    persistent_inventory.json
              ↓
    Survives scene changes + restarts!
```

✓ "[ForgeUIManager] Showing FORGE UI - setting Game context"
✓ "[ForgeManager] Context set to: Game"
