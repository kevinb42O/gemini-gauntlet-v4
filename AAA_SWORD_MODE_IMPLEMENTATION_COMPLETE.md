## ✅ What Was Implemented

### New Files Created:
1. ✅ **SwordDamage.cs** - Damage component (120 lines, zero bloat)
2. ✅ **4 Documentation Files** - Complete guides

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ **Controls.cs** - Added SwordModeToggle key
2. ✅ **InputSettings.cs** - Added swordModeToggle setting
3. ✅ **PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs** - Added sword mode system
4. ✅ **IndividualLayeredHandController.cs** - Added TriggerSwordAttack()

---

## 🎯 Core Features

✅ **Right Hand Only** - Left hand continues shooting (dual-wielding!)  
✅ **Backspace Toggle** - Switch modes anytime  
✅ **Animation Driven** - Perfect timing via animation events  
✅ **Configurable** - All settings in Unity Inspector  
✅ **Ultra Simple** - 3 core methods, no bloat  
✅ **Performance** - Zero GC, minimal CPU  
✅ **Clean Code** - AAA standard, maintainable  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Create Sword GameObject
```
- Create empty GameObject named "PlayerSword"
- Parent to Right Hand bone
- Add SwordDamage component
```

### 2. Configure
```
- SwordDamage → Damage: 50, Radius: 2
- PlayerShooterOrchestrator → Sword Damage: [PlayerSword]
```

### 3. Test
```
- Press Play
- Press Backspace (Console: "SWORD MODE ACTIVATED")
- Press RMB (Sword attack!)
```

**That's it! 3 steps and you're slashing!**

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Backspace** | Toggle sword mode ON/OFF |
| **RMB** | Sword attack (in sword mode) |
| **RMB** | Shoot (in shooting mode) |
| **LMB** | Always shoots (unaffected) |

---

## 🎨 Animator Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For polished combat, add sword animation:

1. Open Right Hand Animator
2. Add trigger: **SwordAttackT**
3. Create state: **SwordAttack** (on Shooting Layer)
4. Add transition: Any State → SwordAttack [SwordAttackT]
5. Add animation event: **DealDamage()** at impact frame

**See AAA_SWORD_MODE_ANIMATOR_SETUP.md for detailed guide!**

---

## 💡 How It Works

```
[Backspace] → Toggle Mode
     ↓
[RMB Click] → Trigger Attack
     ↓
Animation Plays → Sword Swings
     ↓
Animation Event → DealDamage()
     ↓
Sphere Detection → Apply Damage
```

**Simple. Clean. Effective.**

---

## 🎯 Customization

### Change Damage:
```csharp
SwordDamage → Damage = 100
```

### Change Range:
```csharp
SwordDamage → Damage Radius = 3
```

### Change Speed:
```csharp
SwordDamage → Attack Cooldown = 0.3
```

### Change Toggle Key:
```csharp
InputSettings → Sword Mode Toggle = KeyCode.F
```

**All configurable in Inspector - no code changes needed!**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Problem**: No damage  
**Solution**: Check SwordDamage assigned in PlayerShooterOrchestrator

**Problem**: Instant damage  
**Solution**: Add Animation Event to call DealDamage() at impact frame

**Problem**: Can't toggle  
**Solution**: Watch Console for "SWORD MODE ACTIVATED" message

**Problem**: Left hand stops shooting  
**Solution**: Bug! Only secondary (RMB) should check sword mode
