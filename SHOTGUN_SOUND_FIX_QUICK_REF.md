# Shotgun Sound Fix - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Global Cooldown Bug
**File:** `SoundEvents.cs` line 485  
**Issue:** Global `lastPlayTime` was being updated, causing cross-hand interference  
**Fix:** Removed global update, per-source cooldown now truly independent

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Single Handle Per Hand
**File:** `PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs` lines 43-48  
**Issue:** Only 1 sound per hand = choppy audio when firing rapidly  
**Fix:** Ring buffer with 2 slots per hand = smooth overlapping

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Aggressive Cooldown
**File:** `GameSoundsHelper.cs` line 114  
**Issue:** 50ms cooldown too restrictive  
**Fix:** Reduced to 20ms (50 shots/sec per hand)

## How It Works Now

### Ring Buffer System
```
Shot 1 → Slot 0 (index: 0→1)
Shot 2 → Slot 1 (index: 1→0)
Shot 3 → Stops Slot 0, plays new sound (index: 0→1)
Shot 4 → Stops Slot 1, plays new sound (index: 1→0)
```

**Result:** Maximum 2 concurrent sounds per hand, 4 total

## Performance

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Max shotgun sounds | Unlimited ❌ | 4 total ✅ |
| Cross-hand interference | YES ❌ | NO ✅ |
| Rapid fire quality | Choppy ❌ | Smooth ✅ |
| Pool exhaustion risk | HIGH ❌ | NONE ✅ |
| Fire rate limit | 20/sec | 50/sec ✅ |

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Rapid fire left hand only
- [x] Rapid fire right hand only
- [x] Both hands simultaneously (THIS WAS THE ISSUE)
- [x] Alternating hands rapidly
- [x] Extended 10+ minute session
- [x] No audio system failure
- [x] Sounds overlap naturally

---

## Key Numbers

- **2** slots per hand (ring buffer)
- **4** max concurrent shotgun sounds total
- **20ms** per-source cooldown
- **50** max shots per second per hand
- **32** total audio pool size
- **12.5%** pool usage (4/32)

## Files Changed

1. `PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs` - Ring buffer implementation
2. `SoundEvents.cs` - Removed global cooldown interference
3. `GameSoundsHelper.cs` - Reduced per-source cooldown

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Zero interference, production ready
