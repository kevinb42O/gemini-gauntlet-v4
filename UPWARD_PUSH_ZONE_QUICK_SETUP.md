# 🚀 Upward Push Zone - QUICK SETUP (2 Minutes!)

## ✅ THE FIX FOR "PUSHING OUTWARD" ISSUE

**Problem**: Jump pad was preserving your horizontal momentum, making you fly sideways  
**Solution**: New checkbox **"Cancel Horizontal Velocity"** - makes you go STRAIGHT UP! ⬆️

## 🎯 QUICK SETUP FOR STRAIGHT UP JUMP PAD

1. **Create GameObject** with `UpwardPushZone` script
2. **Add Box Collider** (or Sphere Collider)
3. **Check "Is Trigger"** on the collider
4. **Set these values**:
   ```
   Push Force: 600
   Use Impulse Mode: ✅ (checked)
   Cancel Horizontal Velocity: ✅ (checked) ⬆️ THIS IS THE KEY!
   Impulse Cooldown: 0.5
   Zone Radius: 50
   Max Push Height: 500
   ```

5. **Done!** Step on it and you'll launch STRAIGHT UP! 🚀

## 🎮 TWO MODES EXPLAINED

### **⬆️ STRAIGHT UP (Cancel Horizontal = ✅)**
- Zeros out your X and Z velocity
- You go **straight up** regardless of how you entered
- Perfect for: Jump pads, launchers, vertical boost zones
- **This is what you want!**

### **↗️ PRESERVE MOMENTUM (Cancel Horizontal = ❌)**
- Keeps your horizontal velocity (X and Z)
- Adds upward boost to your current movement
- Perfect for: Speed boost pads, momentum-based jumps
- Makes you fly in the direction you were moving

## 📊 RECOMMENDED VALUES

**Your Gravity**: -300  
**Minimum Push Force**: 400+  
**Recommended for Jump Pad**: 600-800

### **Standard Jump Pad (Straight Up)**
```
Push Force: 600
Use Impulse Mode: ✅
Cancel Horizontal Velocity: ✅ ⬆️
Impulse Cooldown: 0.5
```

### **Mega Launcher (ROCKET!)**
```
Push Force: 1000
Use Impulse Mode: ✅
Cancel Horizontal Velocity: ✅ ⬆️
Impulse Cooldown: 1.0
```

### **Updraft Zone (Continuous)**
```
Push Force: 400
Use Impulse Mode: ❌
Cancel Horizontal Velocity: ✅ ⬆️
```

### **Speed Boost Pad (Preserve Momentum)**
```
Push Force: 600
Use Impulse Mode: ✅
Cancel Horizontal Velocity: ❌ ↗️
Impulse Cooldown: 0.5
```

## 🔍 HOW TO TEST

1. Place the jump pad in your scene
2. Make sure collider is set to **"Is Trigger"**
3. Run the game and step on it
4. Check console for these messages:
   ```
   [UpwardPushZone] ✅ PLAYER DETECTED!
   [UpwardPushZone] 🚀 IMPULSE BOOST!
   [UpwardPushZone] ⬆️ STRAIGHT UP! Zeroed horizontal velocity
   [UpwardPushZone] After: Velocity=(0, 600, 0)
   ```

5. If velocity shows `(0, 600, 0)` = **PERFECT!** You're going straight up!
6. If velocity shows `(50, 600, 30)` = You still have horizontal velocity (uncheck "Cancel Horizontal Velocity" if you want this)

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Still pushing sideways?**
- Make sure **"Cancel Horizontal Velocity"** is **CHECKED (✅)**
- Check console - should say "⬆️ STRAIGHT UP! Zeroed horizontal velocity"

### **Not detecting player?**
- Make sure collider has **"Is Trigger"** checked
- Check console for "✅ PLAYER DETECTED!" message
- If you see "❌ NOT PLAYER", your player is missing CharacterController or AAAMovementController

### **Not pushing high enough?**
- Increase **Push Force** (try 800-1000)
- Remember: Push force must be MUCH higher than gravity (-300)
- Check console for velocity values

### **Pushing too high?**
- Decrease **Push Force** (try 400-500)
- Or decrease **Max Push Height**

## 🎯 THAT'S IT!

With **"Cancel Horizontal Velocity"** checked, you'll go **STRAIGHT UP** every time! ⬆️🚀

No more flying sideways into walls! 😄
