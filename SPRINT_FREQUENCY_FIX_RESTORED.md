# SPRINT FREQUENCY FIX RESTORED

## Problem: Arms Swinging in Sync (Rocking Horse Effect)

After jumping and landing back into sprint, both arms would swing together in perfect sync, creating a "rocking horse" effect where the player looks ridiculous.

## Root Cause

**IndividualLayeredHandController.SetMovementState()** had an early return that blocked re-applying the animation offset:

```csharp
public void SetMovementState(MovementState newState)
{
    if (CurrentMovementState == newState) return; // BUG!
```

**What Happened:**
1. Player is sprinting with randomized arm offset (working correctly)
2. Player jumps → state changes to Jump
3. Player lands → tries to return to Sprint
4. Line 215 sees: "Already in Sprint state" → RETURNS EARLY
5. **Animation offset never re-applied** → arms sync together!

The offset calculation was there (`_animationTimeOffset = Random.Range(0f, 1f)`) but it was only applied when the state actually changed. After a jump, returning to Sprint didn't trigger a state change, so the offset was lost.

## Solution Applied

Modified `SetMovementState()` to ALWAYS re-apply the offset for Sprint, even if already in Sprint state:

```csharp
public void SetMovementState(MovementState newState)
{
    // CRITICAL: Don't skip Sprint state - always re-apply offset to prevent arm sync!
    bool wasAlreadyInState = (CurrentMovementState == newState);
    
    // For non-sprint states, skip if already in that state
    if (wasAlreadyInState && newState != MovementState.Sprint)
        return;
    
    CurrentMovementState = newState;
    
    if (handAnimator != null)
    {
        // Only set parameter if state actually changed (avoids animator spam)
        if (!wasAlreadyInState)
        {
            handAnimator.SetInteger("movementState", (int)newState);
            handAnimator.Update(0f);
        }
        
        // ALWAYS apply animation time offset to prevent arms from syncing!
        AnimatorStateInfo stateInfo = handAnimator.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(BASE_LAYER);
        handAnimator.Play(stateInfo.fullPathHash, BASE_LAYER, _animationTimeOffset);
    }
}
```

## Key Changes

1. **Track if already in state**: `bool wasAlreadyInState = (CurrentMovementState == newState);`
2. **Special handling for Sprint**: Only return early for non-Sprint states
3. **Conditional parameter update**: Avoid spamming animator with redundant parameter sets
4. **ALWAYS apply offset**: The offset is applied regardless of state change for Sprint

## Result

✅ **Sprint frequency fix works after jumping**
✅ **Arms no longer sync together** (no more rocking horse effect)
✅ **Each hand maintains randomized offset** throughout all state transitions
✅ **No animator spam** (parameters only updated when needed)
✅ **Offset always applied** when returning to Sprint from any other state

## Technical Details

**Animation Time Offset System:**
- Each hand gets a random offset: `_animationTimeOffset = Random.Range(0f, 1f)`
- This offset is applied via: `handAnimator.Play(stateInfo.fullPathHash, BASE_LAYER, _animationTimeOffset)`
- The offset shifts where the animation starts in its cycle
- Left hand might start at 0.3, right hand at 0.8 → arms swing out of sync
- This creates natural-looking asymmetric arm movement

**Why Sprint Needs Special Treatment:**
- Most states (Jump, Land, Dive) are temporary - no need to re-apply offset
- Sprint is the "default" movement state that you return to repeatedly
- Without re-applying the offset, transitions back to Sprint would reset synchronization
- By always re-applying, arms stay de-synced throughout gameplay

## Testing

1. Start sprinting → arms should swing out of sync ✅
2. Jump while sprinting ✅
3. Land → arms should STILL be out of sync ✅
4. Dive (X key) while sprinting ✅
5. Land from dive → continue sprinting with de-synced arms ✅
