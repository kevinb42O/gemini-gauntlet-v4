# 💀 SKULL SYSTEM TESTING GUIDE

## 🎯 Quick Start - 5 Minute Test

### Test 1: Basic Skull Spawn (2 minutes)

**What to test:** Single skull AI and movement

**Steps:**
1. Open your test scene
2. Drag `SkullEnemy` prefab into scene
3. Position it 20 units from player
4. Press Play
5. Watch skull behavior

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Skull rises slightly (spawning state)
- ✅ Begins hunting player after 1 second
- ✅ Chases player with swooping/circling motion
- ✅ Attacks when close
- ✅ Stays above ground (min 3 units clearance)

**If it fails:**
- Check SkullEnemyManager exists in scene (auto-creates if missing)
- Verify player has "Player" tag and PlayerHealth component
- Check skull's groundLayerMask is set correctly

---

### Test 2: Death System (1 minute)

**What to test:** Death effects and batching

**Steps:**
1. Spawn 1 skull
2. Shoot it until it dies
3. Observe death

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Skull disappears immediately
- ✅ Death particle effect spawns
- ✅ Death sound plays
- ✅ XP/stats updated

---

### Test 3: LOD System (2 minutes)

**What to test:** Distance-based performance scaling

**Steps:**
1. Spawn 3 skulls at different distances:
   - Close: 10 units from player
   - Mid: 40 units from player  
   - Far: 80 units from player
2. Press Play
3. Watch movement patterns

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Close skull: Smooth, responsive AI
- ✅ Mid skull: Slightly choppier updates
- ✅ Far skull: Very slow updates, no separation

**Debug Check:**
- Add SkullEnemyManager to scene manually
- Set `checksPerFrame` to 3 (so you see LOD changes faster)
- Watch skulls transition between LOD levels as you move

## 🔥 Stress Tests - AAA Validation

### Test 4: 100 Skull Performance Test

**What to test:** Can your system handle 100 skulls without lag?

**Setup:**
```csharp
// Create test spawner script or use Unity's duplicate feature:
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    Vector3 randomPos = transform.position + Random.insideUnitSphere * 100f;
    randomPos.y = 10f; // Keep them at safe height
    Instantiate(skullPrefab, randomPos, Quaternion.identity);
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Spawn 100 skulls around player
2. Check FPS (Unity Stats window)
3. Move around

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ FPS stays above 30 (60+ on good hardware)
- ✅ Skulls update smoothly despite high count
- ✅ No physics glitches
- ✅ Player remains responsive

**If FPS drops below 30:**
- Check SkullEnemyManager LOD distances
- Increase `aiTickIntervalMin/Max` for far skulls
- Decrease `checksPerFrame` in SkullEnemyManager

---

### Test 5: Death Spike Prevention (THE BIG ONE)

**What to test:** Does death batching prevent freeze when 50 skulls die at once?

**Setup:**
1. Spawn 50 skulls in a tight cluster
2. Use AOE weapon or explosive to kill all at once
3. Watch FPS during death

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ **NO FPS SPIKE** - This is the killer feature
- ✅ Death effects spawn over 17 frames (3 per frame)
- ✅ Death sounds limited to 3 per frame
- ✅ Game remains smooth

**Debug Check:**
```csharp
// Add this to Update in any script to monitor:
Debug.Log(SkullDeathManager.GetQueueStatus());
```

You should see queue sizes gradually process instead of instant spike.

**If you DO see freeze:**
- Check SkullDeathManager exists in scene
- Verify skulls are using SkullDeathManager.QueueDeathEffect()
- Check Unity Profiler for bottleneck

## 🛩️ Flying Skull Tests

### Test 6: Flying Skull Indoor Navigation

**What to test:** Obstacle avoidance in tight spaces

**Steps:**
1. Create simple indoor room with walls/ceiling
2. Spawn FlyingSkullEnemy inside
3. Watch movement

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Skull avoids walls (2m clearance)
- ✅ Skull avoids ceiling (2m clearance)
- ✅ Skull avoids ground (3m clearance)
- ✅ Smooth pathfinding around obstacles

**If skull clips through walls:**
- Check `obstacleLayers` includes walls
- Increase `wallClearance` value
- Verify obstacles have colliders

---

### Test 7: Multi-Level Spawn System

**What to test:** FlyingSkullSpawnManager's level system

**Setup:**
1. Add FlyingSkullSpawnManager to scene
2. Create 3 empty GameObjects as level centers:
   - Level1Center (Y = 0)
   - Level2Center (Y = 10)
   - Level3Center (Y = 20)
3. Configure in inspector:
   - Level 1: 5 skulls, 30m radius
   - Level 2: 5 skulls, 30m radius
   - Level 3: 5 skulls, 30m radius
4. Set spawn check radius to 2m
5. Enable gizmos

**Steps:**
1. Look at scene view - see colored circles
2. Press Play
3. Watch console for spawn reports

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ See 3 colored spawn zones in scene
- ✅ Console shows spawn reports per level
- ✅ 15 skulls spawn across 3 levels
- ✅ Skulls maintain minimum spacing (10m default)

**Gizmo colors:**
- 🔴 Red = Level 1
- 🟢 Green = Level 2
- 🔵 Blue = Level 3

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Skulls sink through ground

**Fix:**
1. Check `groundLayerMask` includes your floor layer
2. Increase `minGroundClearance` (try 5m)
3. Verify floor has collider
4. Check `absoluteMinWorldHeight` is below your world

---

### Issue: Skulls don't chase player

**Fix:**
1. Verify player has "Player" tag
2. Check PlayerHealth component exists on player
3. Increase `playerDetectionRange`
4. Check no errors in console blocking FindAndCachePlayer()

---

### Issue: Performance lag with many skulls

**Fix:**
1. SkullEnemyManager settings:
   - Increase `nearDistance` → `midDistance` → effect: more skulls in Far LOD
   - Decrease `checksPerFrame` → effect: slower LOD updates but less CPU
2. SkullEnemy settings:
   - Increase `aiTickIntervalMin/Max` → effect: slower AI updates
   - Decrease `separationBufferSize` → effect: fewer separation checks
3. SkullDeathManager settings:
   - Decrease `maxDeathEffectsPerFrame` → effect: slower VFX but smoother

---

### Issue: Death sounds too quiet or missing

**Check:**
1. SkullDeathManager exists in scene
2. SkullSoundEvents system is configured
3. Audio listeners are active
4. Volume settings in inspector

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### What To Expect (on mid-range PC):

| Skull Count | Expected FPS | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| 1-10 | 60+ | Butter smooth |
| 10-50 | 60 | Should be smooth |
| 50-100 | 45-60 | LOD system kicks in |
| 100-200 | 30-45 | Far LOD does heavy lifting |
| 200+ | 25-30 | Pushing limits (still playable!) |

### 50 Skulls Die At Once:

| System | FPS Drop | Recovery Time |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **With Batching** | ~5 FPS | Instant |
| Without Batching | ~30 FPS | 1-2 seconds |

This is the **smoking gun** of AAA optimization.

## ✅ Quick Validation Checklist

Run through this in 10 minutes to verify everything works:

- [ ] Spawn 1 skull - it chases player
- [ ] Kill 1 skull - death VFX plays
- [ ] Spawn 10 skulls - they separate (don't cluster)
- [ ] Spawn 100 skulls - FPS stays above 30
- [ ] Kill 50 skulls at once - no freeze
- [ ] Flying skull avoids walls/ceiling
- [ ] Multi-level spawn creates 3 levels
- [ ] LOD system visible (skulls far away update slower)

**If all checks pass: Your system is production-ready! 🎉**

## 🎮 Advanced Testing

### Test Attack Patterns

Your skulls have 3 attack patterns. To see them:

1. Spawn 9 skulls
2. Watch their approaches
3. You should see:
   - **DirectAssault**: Straight line with slight weaving
   - **SwoopingDive**: Vertical bobbing with swoops
   - **CirclingPredator**: Circles player before attacking

Each skull randomly gets one pattern on spawn.

---

### Test Dynamic Targeting

1. Spawn companion (if you have companion system)
2. Spawn 5 skulls
3. Move away from companion
4. Watch skulls - some should target companion

Skulls target **closest valid target** (player or companions).

---

### Test Separation System

1. Spawn 20 skulls in same location
2. Watch them spread out
3. Expected: They push away from each other

This is the anti-clustering system.

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

Your skull system is **production-ready** if:

✅ Skulls chase player smoothly  
✅ Death effects work properly  
✅ 100 skulls maintain 30+ FPS  
✅ 50 deaths at once = no freeze  
✅ Ground avoidance works  
✅ Flying skulls navigate indoors  

**If all pass: You have AAA-tier skull enemies!** 🎯

## 📝 Notes

- Tests assume mid-range PC (i5/Ryzen 5, GTX 1060/RX 580)
- VR/Mobile will need lower skull counts
- High-end PC can handle 300+ skulls
- LOD system scales automatically - no tweaking needed for most cases

**Happy Testing!** 💀
