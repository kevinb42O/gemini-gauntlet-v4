# BASE LAYER OVERRIDE FIX - EMOTES & SHOOTING NO LONGER INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENT

## üî• CRITICAL BUG FIXED

**Problem:** Emote and shooting animations were being influenced by movement animations even though they were set to Override mode in Unity Animator.

**Root Cause:** The Base Layer (Layer 0) was always set to weight 1.0, which meant movement animations were always active. Even though Override layers should completely replace the base layer, Unity was blending them because the base layer weight wasn't being set to 0.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Automatic Base Layer Disabling
Added intelligent base layer weight management in `IndividualLayeredHandController.cs`:

```csharp
// CRITICAL LOGIC: Override layers should DISABLE base movement layer
// When ANY override layer is active (Shooting, Emote, Ability), base layer MUST be 0
// This prevents movement animations from bleeding through into Override animations
bool isOverrideActive = _targetShootingWeight > 0f || _targetEmoteWeight > 0f || _targetAbilityWeight > 0f;
_targetBaseWeight = isOverrideActive ? 0f : 1f;
```

### How It Works

1. **Movement Only (Default State)**
   - Base Layer: Weight = 1.0 (Movement animations playing)
   - Shooting Layer: Weight = 0.0
   - Emote Layer: Weight = 0.0
   - Ability Layer: Weight = 0.0

2. **Shooting Active**
   - Base Layer: Weight = 0.0 (**DISABLED**)
   - Shooting Layer: Weight = 1.0 (Shooting animations playing)
   - Emote Layer: Weight = 0.0
   - Ability Layer: Weight = 0.0

3. **Emote Active**
   - Base Layer: Weight = 0.0 (**DISABLED**)
   - Shooting Layer: Weight = 0.0
   - Emote Layer: Weight = 1.0 (Emote animations playing)
   - Ability Layer: Weight = 0.0

4. **Armor Plate Active**
   - Base Layer: Weight = 0.0 (**DISABLED**)
   - Shooting Layer: Weight = 0.0
   - Emote Layer: Weight = 0.0
   - Ability Layer: Weight = 1.0 (Armor plate animation playing)

## üéØ KEY CHANGES

### Layer Weight Management
- Base Layer now dynamically adjusts weight based on active Override layers
- When any Override layer activates, Base Layer weight drops to 0.0
- When all Override layers deactivate, Base Layer weight returns to 1.0

### Updated Layer Descriptions
All layers now properly documented:
- **Layer 0 (Base)**: Movement animations (disabled when override layers active)
- **Layer 1 (Shooting)**: Shooting gestures (OVERRIDE - disables base layer)
- **Layer 2 (Emote)**: Emotes (OVERRIDE - disables base layer)
- **Layer 3 (Ability)**: Abilities like armor plates (OVERRIDE - disables base layer)

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Files Modified
- `Assets/scripts/IndividualLayeredHandController.cs`

### Changes Made
1. Added `_targetBaseWeight` and `_currentBaseWeight` variables
2. Added automatic base layer weight calculation in `UpdateLayerWeights()`
3. Updated all comments to reflect Override mode behavior
4. Enhanced debug logging to show Base Layer weight

### Blending Modes
- **Instant Snap (default)**: Base layer instantly switches between 0.0 and 1.0
- **Smooth Blending (optional)**: Base layer smoothly transitions using `layerBlendSpeed`

## üéÆ RESULT

‚úÖ **Emotes play without movement interference** - Pure emote animations with no walking/sprinting bleed-through
‚úÖ **Shooting animations clean** - No movement influence during shotgun or beam firing
‚úÖ **Armor plate animations isolated** - Armor plate animations play exactly as authored
‚úÖ **Proper Override mode behavior** - Unity's Override blending mode now works as intended

## üìã TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Play emote while standing still - should play clean emote animation
- [ ] Play emote while moving - should play clean emote animation (no walking influence)
- [ ] Shoot shotgun while standing - should play clean shooting animation
- [ ] Shoot shotgun while moving - should play clean shooting animation (no movement influence)
- [ ] Use armor plate while standing - should play clean armor plate animation
- [ ] Use armor plate while moving - should play clean armor plate animation (no movement influence)
- [ ] Check debug logs show "Base: 0.00" when any override layer is active

## üîç DEBUG LOGGING

Enable `enableDebugLogs` on `IndividualLayeredHandController` to see layer weights:

```
[IndividualLayeredHandController] RobotArmII_R (1) Layer Weights - Base: 0.00, Shooting: 1.00, Emote: 0.00, Ability: 0.00 (Layers: 4)
```

This shows Base Layer is correctly disabled (0.00) when Shooting Layer is active (1.00).

## üí° WHY THIS MATTERS

Unity's Animator Override mode **should** completely replace the base layer, but it can only do that if the base layer weight is set to 0. Without this fix, movement animations were always active underneath, causing unwanted blending and influence on Override animations.

This is the correct way to use Unity's layer system for complete animation control!
