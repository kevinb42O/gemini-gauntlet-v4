# ðŸ”§ Sound System 5-Minute Crash - Quick Fix Summary

## The Problem
Sound system breaks after ~5 minutes of gameplay.

## The Cause
**Shotgun blast sound** was creating **hundreds of coroutines** that never got cleaned up.

## The Fix
**Disabled volume rolloff for shotgun sounds** - removed the feature that was causing coroutine accumulation.

## What Changed

### File 1: `GameSoundsHelper.cs`
**Line 55-73:** Removed rolloff configuration from `SafePlayShotgunSound3D()`
- Shotgun sounds now play normally without triggering coroutines
- Unity handles audio clip endings smoothly without clicking

### File 2: `SoundEvents.cs`
**Line 452-502:** Improved `VolumeRolloffCoroutine()` safeguards
- Coroutines now exit immediately if sound stops early
- Prevents accumulation for any other sounds using rolloff

## How to Test
1. **Fire shotgun rapidly for 5+ minutes**
2. **Verify sounds still work after 10 minutes**
3. **Check Unity Profiler** - coroutine count should stay low (0-10)

## Expected Result
âœ… Sound system remains stable indefinitely
âœ… No performance degradation over time
âœ… No memory leaks

## If Issues Persist
1. Open Unity Profiler
2. Check "Coroutines" count
3. If still accumulating, check other sounds with `useVolumeRolloff = true`
