# ðŸ”¥ WHAT'S NEW: SKATE-STYLE ENHANCEMENTS

## ðŸŽ® THE UPGRADE

Your Aerial Freestyle Trick System just got the **Skate treatment**. We've added analog speed control that gives you complete mastery over every rotation - just like Skate's legendary flick-it system.

---

## âš¡ THREE GAME-CHANGING FEATURES

### **1. Initial Burst (The Flick-It)**
```
Hold LEFT ALT â†’ âš¡ BURST! â†’ Fast rotation starts INSTANTLY
```

**What It Does:**
- Camera **instantly** starts rotating at 2.5x speed
- Lasts for 0.15 seconds
- Creates the satisfying "flick" feel from Skate
- No delay, no ramp-up, just instant response

**Why It's Amazing:**
- Feels like you're **throwing** the flip
- Instant gratification
- Easier to initiate tricks
- Satisfying tactile feedback

---

### **2. Analog Speed Control**
```
Fast mouse movement â†’ Fast rotation
Slow mouse movement â†’ Slow rotation
Stop mouse â†’ Rotation stops
```

**What It Does:**
- Your **mouse movement speed** directly controls rotation speed
- Range: 0.2x (slow) to 2.5x (fast)
- Smooth transitions between speeds
- Can pause mid-flip and resume

**Why It's Amazing:**
- **Complete control** over flip speed
- Slow down to "stick" landings
- Speed up to complete rotations
- Pause for style points
- Feels organic and responsive

---

### **3. Dynamic Smoothing**
```
During burst â†’ Minimal smoothing (instant response)
During analog â†’ Normal smoothing (precision control)
```

**What It Does:**
- Less smoothing during initial burst (0.3x)
- Normal smoothing during analog control (1.0x)
- Automatically adjusts based on phase

**Why It's Amazing:**
- Fast initiation when you need it
- Precise control when you want it
- Best of both worlds
- No compromise

---

## ðŸŽ¯ HOW IT FEELS

### **Before (Good):**
```
Hold ALT â†’ Constant rotation â†’ Land
```
- Predictable
- Easy to use
- Limited expression

### **After (LEGENDARY):**
```
Hold ALT â†’ âš¡BURST! â†’ Analog control â†’ Precision landing
```
- **Flick-it feel** on activation
- **Full speed control** throughout
- **Infinite expression** possibilities
- **Skate-level satisfaction**

---

## ðŸŽ¨ VISUAL FEEDBACK

### **UI Shows Everything:**

**During Initial Burst:**
```
âš¡ BURST! âš¡
BACKFLIP: 0.3x
```

**During Analog Control:**
```
BACKFLIP: 0.8x
SPEED: [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘] 2.1x
```

The speed bar is your **speedometer** - watch it change as you move your mouse!

## ðŸ”§ NEW INSPECTOR SETTINGS

### **You Can Now Control:**

1. **Initial Flip Burst Multiplier** (2.5x default)
   - How fast the initial "flick" is
   - Higher = more aggressive

2. **Initial Burst Duration** (0.15s default)
   - How long the burst lasts
   - Shorter = faster transition to analog

3. **Enable Analog Speed Control** (TRUE default)
   - Master toggle for analog control
   - Disable for constant-speed rotation

4. **Speed Control Responsiveness** (8.0 default)
   - How quickly rotation speed changes
   - Higher = more responsive

5. **Min Input Threshold** (0.01 default)
   - Minimum mouse movement to maintain rotation
   - Prevents accidental drift

---

## ðŸ’¡ NEW TECHNIQUES UNLOCKED

### **The Speed Pump:**
Move mouse in pulses for rhythm:
```
Fast â†’ Slow â†’ Fast â†’ Slow
Creates a "pumping" rhythm like Skate
```

### **The Stall:**
Stop mouse completely mid-flip:
```
Flip â†’ STOP â†’ Hang inverted â†’ Resume
Maximum style points
```

### **The Precision Landing:**
Slow down as you approach upright:
```
Fast flip â†’ Gradually slow â†’ Fine-tune â†’ Perfect landing
```

### **The Speed Burst:**
Alternate between slow and fast:
```
Slow start â†’ BURST â†’ Complete quickly
Dynamic and exciting
```
