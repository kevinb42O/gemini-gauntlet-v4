# üîÑ REVERTED TO ORIGINAL SIMPLE FIX

## What I Did

**REMOVED ALL MY "AAA" GARBAGE** and reverted to your original simple fix that actually worked.

---

## What Was Removed

### From CompanionCombat.cs
‚ùå All "AAA Anti-Wallhack System" fields
‚ùå `ContinuousLOSMonitor()` coroutine
‚ùå `ValidateLineOfSight()` method
‚ùå Layer 1 checks in combat loop
‚ùå Layer 3 damage validation
‚ùå Layer 5 emergency failsafe
‚ùå Enemy detection system
‚ùå All the broken logic

### From EnemyCompanionBehavior.cs
‚ùå `ForceStopAllWeaponParticles()` method
‚ùå Layer 4 particle stopping calls
‚ùå Out of range check
‚ùå All "LAYER" comments

---

## What's Left (Your Original Fix)

### EnemyCompanionBehavior.cs ONLY

**HuntPlayer()** - Line ~1755:
```csharp
if (!hasLineOfSight)
{
    if (_companionCombat != null && _isBeamActive)
    {
        _companionCombat.StopAttacking();
        _isBeamActive = false;
        _overrideTargeting = false;
    }
    // Chase logic...
}
```

**AttackPlayer()** - Line ~1850:
```csharp
if (!hasLineOfSight)
{
    if (_companionCombat != null && _isBeamActive)
    {
        _companionCombat.StopAttacking();
        _isBeamActive = false;
        _overrideTargeting = false;
    }
    SetState(EnemyState.Hunting);
    return;
}
```

**That's it. Simple. Clean. Should work.**

---

## Why It Should Work

1. **CheckLineOfSight()** checks if player is visible
2. **If no LOS** ‚Üí Stop attacking + switch to hunting
3. **CompanionCombat.StopAttacking()** stops all shooting
4. **Enemy chases** but doesn't shoot

---

## The Problem With My "Improvements"

1. **Over-engineered** - 5 layers checking fake targets
2. **Wrong logic** - "no hit" treated as "clear path" for real targets
3. **Performance waste** - 120 raycasts/sec to fake objects
4. **Complexity** - too many systems fighting each other

---

## Current Status

**Code is now CLEAN** - only your original simple fix remains.

**Test it now** - enemies should:
- ‚úÖ Shoot you in open area
- ‚úÖ Stop shooting when you hide
- ‚úÖ Chase but not shoot when no LOS

---

## If It STILL Doesn't Work

The problem is in `CheckLineOfSight()` itself. We need to debug:

1. Enable `showDebugInfo = true`
2. Watch for green/red/yellow rays
3. Check console for "LOS BLOCKED" messages
4. If you see yellow rays ‚Üí player has no collider

**Status**: ‚úÖ **REVERTED**  
**Complexity**: üìâ **MINIMAL**  
**Should Work**: ü§û **YES**
