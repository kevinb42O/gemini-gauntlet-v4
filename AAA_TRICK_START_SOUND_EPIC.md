## 🔧 Advanced Customization

### Make It Even More Epic
In `AAACameraController.cs`, you could add:

**Volume scales with airtime:**
```csharp
float airtime = Time.time - airborneStartTime;
float volumeBoost = Mathf.Clamp(1.0f + (airtime * 0.2f), 1.0f, 1.5f);
GeminiGauntlet.Audio.GameSounds.PlayTrickStartSound(transform.position, volumeBoost);
```

**Pitch varies with rotation speed:**
```csharp
float rotationSpeed = freestyleLookInput.magnitude;
float pitchMod = 1.0f - (rotationSpeed * 0.1f); // Lower pitch for faster spins
// Apply pitch modification to sound
```

### Combo with Other Effects
- **Screen shake**: Add camera shake on trick start
- **Particle burst**: Spawn particles around player
- **FOV change**: Widen FOV during slow-mo
- **Color grading**: Desaturate colors slightly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Sound Not Playing?
1. ✅ Check sound is assigned in `SoundEvents.asset`
2. ✅ Look for debug log: "🔥 TRICK START SOUND!"
3. ✅ Verify middle-click triggers trick
4. ✅ Check Audio Listener is on camera

### Sound Too Quiet?
- Increase volume in SoundEvent settings (1.2-1.5)
- Check your audio clip's volume
- Verify SFX category volume in Audio Mixer

### Sound Doesn't Match Slow-Mo?
- The sound plays at NORMAL speed (not slowed)
- This is CORRECT - creates contrast with slowed visuals
- If you want slowed sound, use audio pitch shift in Unity

### Multiple Sounds Playing?
- This is normal if you spam middle-click
- Each trick start gets its own sound
- Consider adding cooldown if needed
