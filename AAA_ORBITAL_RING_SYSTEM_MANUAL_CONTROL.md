# 🎯 Orbital Ring System - Manual Control Guide

## Overview
The orbital platform system has been upgraded to give you **complete manual control** over platform placement with **visual gizmos** in the editor.

## ✅ What Changed

### Before (Old System)
- ❌ Used `minRadius` and `maxRadius` with random distribution
- ❌ Platforms spawned at unpredictable distances
- ❌ No visual feedback in editor
- ❌ Hard to control exact placement

### After (New System)
- ✅ **Discrete rings** with exact radii you define
- ✅ **No random spawning** between rings
- ✅ **Gizmo visualization** shows exactly where platforms will spawn
- ✅ **Full manual control** over every ring

---

## 🎨 Gizmo Visualization

### What You'll See
1. **Colored rings** showing the exact radius of each orbital ring
2. **Sphere markers** at each platform spawn position
3. **Lines from center** to each platform (when selected)
4. **Labels** showing radius distance and platform count

### Gizmo Colors
- Each ring can have its own color (set in `gizmoColor` field)
- **Transparent** when not selected (30% opacity)
- **Bright** when GameObject is selected (80% opacity)

## 🔧 How to Configure Rings

### Step 1: Select Your UniverseGenerator or OrbitalSystem GameObject

### Step 2: Expand the Orbital Tier Configuration

### Step 3: Add Rings to Your Tier

Each **OrbitalTierConfig** now has a **Rings** list instead of minRadius/maxRadius.

#### Ring Properties:
```
📍 Radius (float)
   - Exact distance from center where platforms spawn
   - Example: 50, 100, 150 for three distinct rings

🔢 Platform Count (int)
   - How many platforms on this specific ring
   - Example: 8 platforms evenly spaced around the ring

🔄 Angle Offset (0-360°)
   - Rotates the starting position of platforms
   - Use this to stagger rings so they don't align perfectly
   - Example: Ring 1 = 0°, Ring 2 = 22.5°, Ring 3 = 45°

🎨 Gizmo Color
   - Color to display this ring in the Scene view
   - Helps distinguish between different rings
   - Example: Inner ring = Cyan, Middle = Yellow, Outer = Magenta
```

## 📝 Example Configuration

### Simple 3-Ring System
```
Tier: "Inner System"
├─ Ring 1
│  ├─ Radius: 30
│  ├─ Platform Count: 6
│  ├─ Angle Offset: 0°
│  └─ Gizmo Color: Cyan
│
├─ Ring 2
│  ├─ Radius: 60
│  ├─ Platform Count: 12
│  ├─ Angle Offset: 15°
│  └─ Gizmo Color: Yellow
│
└─ Ring 3
   ├─ Radius: 90
   ├─ Platform Count: 18
   ├─ Angle Offset: 30°
   └─ Gizmo Color: Magenta
```

### Result
- **Ring 1**: 6 platforms at exactly 30 units from center
- **Ring 2**: 12 platforms at exactly 60 units from center (slightly rotated)
- **Ring 3**: 18 platforms at exactly 90 units from center (more rotated)
- **No platforms spawn between 30-60 or 60-90 units**

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Use Angle Offset to Stagger Rings
```
Ring 1: Offset = 0°
Ring 2: Offset = 180° / platformCount of Ring 1
Ring 3: Offset = 180° / platformCount of Ring 2
```
This prevents platforms from aligning in straight lines.

### 2. Use Different Colors for Each Ring
Makes it easy to see which ring is which in the Scene view.

### 3. Increase Platform Count with Radius
Outer rings have more circumference, so they can hold more platforms without crowding:
```
Radius 30  → 8 platforms
Radius 60  → 16 platforms
Radius 90  → 24 platforms
Radius 120 → 32 platforms
```

### 4. Test in Scene View First
- Select your UniverseGenerator/OrbitalSystem
- Look at the gizmos in Scene view
- Adjust radii and counts until it looks right
- **Then** enter Play mode to test

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any gizmos"
- Make sure **Gizmos are enabled** in Scene view (button in top-right)
- Select the GameObject with OrbitalSystem component
- Check that your tier has rings defined

### "Platforms still spawn randomly"
- Make sure you're using the **new system**
- Old configurations with `minRadius`/`maxRadius` won't work
- You need to define **rings** in the inspector

### "I want to add more rings"
- In the Inspector, expand your Tier
- Find the **Rings** list
- Click the **+** button to add a new ring
- Set its radius, platform count, and color

### "Rings overlap in weird ways"
- Check that each ring has a **unique radius**
- Make sure radii are spaced far enough apart
- Use gizmos to visualize before running

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Checklist

1. ✅ Select UniverseGenerator or OrbitalSystem GameObject
2. ✅ Expand an Orbital Tier
3. ✅ Clear old minRadius/maxRadius values (if any)
4. ✅ Add rings to the **Rings** list
5. ✅ Set radius, platform count, and angle offset for each ring
6. ✅ Assign different gizmo colors to each ring
7. ✅ Look at Scene view to see the gizmos
8. ✅ Adjust until it looks perfect
9. ✅ Enter Play mode to test

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Create Gaps Between Rings
Leave empty space between radii for gameplay:
```
Ring 1: Radius 40
Ring 2: Radius 80  (40 unit gap)
Ring 3: Radius 140 (60 unit gap)
```

### Create Dense Inner Rings
More platforms closer to center for intense combat:
```
Ring 1: Radius 30, Count 12
Ring 2: Radius 35, Count 12
Ring 3: Radius 40, Count 12
```

### Create Sparse Outer Rings
Fewer platforms far away for exploration:
```
Ring 4: Radius 100, Count 8
Ring 5: Radius 150, Count 6
Ring 6: Radius 200, Count 4
```
