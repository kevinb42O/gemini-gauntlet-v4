# üö® SLIDING SYSTEM - BROKEN DIAGNOSIS & FIX

## üìä YOUR CURRENT VALUES (BROKEN):

diveSlideFriction: 1            ‚ùå 1800x TOO WEAK (dive never stops)
```

## üî• WHY IT'S BROKEN:

### **Problem #1: GRAVITY TOO WEAK + NO FRICTION = STUCK**
- You have **near-zero friction** (0.0003) expecting gravity to accelerate you
- But **slideGravityAccel = 250** is 13x weaker than it should be (3240)
- **Result:** You don't accelerate on slopes, and you don't slow down on flats
- **Physics is BROKEN:** No force to move you, no force to stop you

### **Problem #2: MOMENTUM DRAIN**
- **momentumPreservation = 0.88599** means you lose **11.4% speed per frame**
- At 60 FPS, you lose **99.9% of your speed in 0.4 seconds**
- **Result:** Even if you build speed, it dies instantly

### **Problem #3: GLUED TO GROUND**
- **stickToGroundVelocity = 250** is 11x too strong
- This PULLS you down with 250 units/sec force
- **Result:** Can't launch off ramps, can't get air, feels heavy and stuck

### **Problem #4: CAN'T EXIT SLIDE**
- **slideAutoStandSpeed = 10** is way too low
- You need to slow to 10 units/sec to auto-stand
- For a 320-unit character, that's **GLACIAL** speed
- **Result:** You're stuck sliding forever even when stopped

### **Problem #5: DIVE NEVER ENDS**
- **diveSlideFriction = 1** (should be 1800!)
- After diving, you slide with almost no friction
- **Result:** Dive momentum never dissipates, you slide forever

## üî¨ PHYSICS MATH BREAKDOWN:

### **Momentum Preservation (CRITICAL):**
```
Current (BROKEN): 0.88599
- Per frame loss: 11.4%
- After 1 second (60 frames): Speed √ó (0.88599^60) = Speed √ó 0.001 = 99.9% LOSS
- Result: Speed dies in 0.4 seconds

Fixed: 0.96
- Per frame loss: 4%
- After 1 second (60 frames): Speed √ó (0.96^60) = Speed √ó 0.088 = 91.2% LOSS
- Result: Speed persists for 2-3 seconds (natural feel)

On slopes: 0.96 √ó 1.25 = 1.2
- Per frame GAIN: 20%
- After 1 second: Speed √ó (1.2^60) = Speed √ó 56,347 = MASSIVE GAIN (capped by maxSpeed)
- Result: Exhilarating downhill acceleration!
```

### **Gravity Acceleration:**
```
Current (BROKEN): 250 units/sec¬≤
- At 60 FPS: 250 / 60 = 4.17 units per frame
- After 1 second: 250 units/sec speed gain
- Result: Barely noticeable acceleration

Fixed: 3240 units/sec¬≤
- At 60 FPS: 3240 / 60 = 54 units per frame
- After 1 second: 3240 units/sec speed gain
- Result: Strong, satisfying downhill rush!
```

### **Friction Deceleration:**
```
Current (BROKEN): 0.0003 units/sec¬≤
- At 60 FPS: 0.0003 / 60 = 0.000005 units per frame
- After 1 second: 0.0003 units/sec speed loss
- Result: ZERO friction (ice physics)

Fixed: 36 units/sec¬≤
- At 60 FPS: 36 / 60 = 0.6 units per frame
- After 1 second: 36 units/sec speed loss
- Result: Gentle slowdown, maintains flow

## üöÄ TEST PROCEDURE:

1. **Flat Ground Test:**

   - Press Ctrl ‚Üí Should slide smoothly
   - Should slow down gradually over 2-3 seconds

   - Press Ctrl while moving ‚Üí Should start sliding
   - Speed should BUILD as you go downhill
   - Should feel fast and exhilarating

3. **Dive Test:**
   - Sprint at full speed
   - Press Shift ‚Üí Should launch forward dramatically
   - Should land and slide with gradual slowdown
   - Should feel powerful and responsive

## üé™ ADVANCED: MOMENTUM COMPOUNDING EXPLAINED

The system has a **hidden multiplier** on slopes:

```csharp
// Line 970-972 in CleanAAACrouch.cs
float preserveFactor = onSlope ? momentumPreservation * 1.25f : momentumPreservation;
// On slopes: 0.96 * 1.25 = 1.2 (20% GAIN per frame!)
// On flat: 0.96 (4% loss per frame)
```

This means:
- **Flat ground:** Momentum decays at 4% per frame (natural slowdown)
- **Slopes:** Momentum GROWS at 20% per frame (up to maxSpeed)
- **Result:** The longer you slide downhill, the FASTER you go!

This is **INTENTIONAL** for flow state gameplay - you're rewarded for maintaining slides!

---

## üí° WHY YOUR OLD VALUES BROKE IT:

You tried to create "ice physics" by setting friction to near-zero (0.0003), but then:
1. Weakened gravity to 250 (can't build speed)
2. Lowered momentum preservation to 0.88599 (speed dies instantly)
3. Increased stick-to-ground to 250 (can't get air)

**Result:** No force to accelerate you, no momentum to carry you, too much ground adhesion = STUCK!

The system needs **BALANCED** values:
- Moderate friction (36) to slow you on flats
- Strong gravity (3240) to accelerate you on slopes
- High momentum preservation (0.96) to maintain flow
- Gentle ground adhesion (66) to allow ramp launches
