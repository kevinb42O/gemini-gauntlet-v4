# ✅ AAA WALL JUMP - FINAL FIX (From AA to AAA)

## Complete Analysis of What Was Broken

### 1. Config Values Not Being Read
- **Line 3111:** Used `wallJumpInputInfluence` (lowercase) instead of `WallJumpInputInfluence` (property)
- Result: Your MovementConfig changes did NOTHING

### 2. Momentum Being Added Instead of Preserved
- **Old:** `velocity = wallJumpVelocity + (currentVelocity * 1.0)`
- With 1500 current speed: `velocity = 3480 + 1500 = 4980` (FLYING!)
- Result: Exponential speed gain on every wall jump

### 3. Three Directions Being Combined
- **OUTWARD** (perpendicular) + **FORWARD** (tangent) + **CAMERA** (look direction)
- All three were ADDED together creating diagonal unpredictable forces
- Result: Wrong direction, massive forward push

### 4. Complex Confusing Logic
- Input steering
- Movement direction tangent
- Wall normal perpendicular
- Camera direction
- All blended with Lerp and dot products
- Result: Impossible to tune, unpredictable behavior

## The AAA Solution - Clean & Simple

### Direction Logic (SIMPLE)
```csharp
// ONE direction, no blending
if (has camera && camera boost > 0)
    direction = camera forward  // Where you look
else
    direction = wall normal     // Away from wall
```

### Force Calculation (SIMPLE)
```csharp
// UPWARD: Constant
upForce = 1900

// HORIZONTAL: Base + Camera + Fall Energy
horizontalForce = 1200              // Base
if (using camera)
    horizontalForce += 1800         // Camera boost
horizontalForce += fallSpeed * 0.6  // Fall energy

// VELOCITY
velocity = (direction * horizontalForce) + (up * upForce)
```

### Momentum Preservation (FIXED)
```csharp
// OLD (BROKEN):
wallJumpMomentumPreservation = 1.0
velocity = wallJumpVelocity + (currentVelocity * 1.0)
// = 3480 + 1500 = 4980 (FLYING!)

// NEW (FIXED):
wallJumpMomentumPreservation = 0.0
velocity = wallJumpVelocity + (currentVelocity * 0.0)
// = 3480 + 0 = 3480 (CONTROLLED!)
```

## Force Breakdown (AAA)

### Config Values (All Read from MovementConfig.cs)
```csharp
wallJumpUpForce = 1900                    // ✅ Using property
wallJumpOutForce = 1200                   // ✅ Using property
wallJumpCameraDirectionBoost = 1800       // ✅ Using property
wallJumpFallSpeedBonus = 0.6              // ✅ Using property
wallJumpMomentumPreservation = 0.0        // ✅ FIXED: No stacking
```

### Example: Wall Jump While Moving at 1500 units/s, Falling at 800 units/s

**Direction:**
- Camera forward (where you're looking)

**Forces:**
```
UPWARD:
  1900 (constant)

HORIZONTAL:
  Base:        1200
  Camera:      1800
  Fall energy: 800 * 0.6 = 480
  Total:       3480
```

**Velocity:**
```
wallJumpVelocity = (cameraDir * 3480) + (up * 1900)

Momentum preservation = 0.0:
preservedVelocity = currentVelocity * 0.0 = 0

Final velocity = wallJumpVelocity + preservedVelocity
               = 3480 + 0
               = 3480 in camera direction
```

**Result:** Clean 3480 units/s in the direction you're looking. No stacking. No flying.

## What Changed

### Removed (Confusing Stuff)
- ❌ Input steering with Lerp
- ❌ Movement direction tangent calculation
- ❌ Forward boost separate from outward push
- ❌ Input boost multipliers
- ❌ Three-way force combination
- ❌ Momentum being added as boost

### Added (AAA Quality)
- ✅ Simple direction priority (Camera > Wall Normal)
- ✅ Single horizontal force calculation
- ✅ All config values read via properties
- ✅ Momentum preservation = 0 (fresh start)
- ✅ Clean debug logging
- ✅ Predictable, tunable behavior

## How It Feels Now

### Direction
- **Where you look is where you go** (camera direction)
- **No synthetic blending** (one direction, clean)
- **Predictable** (same input = same output)

### Speed
- **Controlled** (no exponential growth)
- **Consistent** (wall jump = fresh start)
- **Tunable** (change config values, they actually work!)

### Fall Energy
- **Fast falls = more horizontal speed** (480 bonus at 800 fall speed)
- **Slow falls = less boost** (120 bonus at 200 fall speed)
- **Energy conservation** (like Titanfall/Celeste)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Change `wallJumpOutForce` in MovementConfig → Should affect horizontal speed
- [ ] Change `wallJumpCameraDirectionBoost` → Should affect camera control strength
- [ ] Change `wallJumpFallSpeedBonus` → Should affect fall energy conversion
- [ ] Wall jump while looking different directions → Should go where you look
- [ ] Multiple wall jumps in a row → Should NOT exponentially increase speed
- [ ] Wall jump with no camera → Should bounce away from wall

## Summary

**From AA to AAA:**
- ✅ Removed all confusing logic
- ✅ Fixed config values being ignored
- ✅ Fixed momentum stacking
- ✅ Fixed wrong direction
- ✅ Fixed flying forward
- ✅ Clean, simple, tunable

**The wall jump is now AAA quality: predictable, controllable, and actually uses your config values!**
