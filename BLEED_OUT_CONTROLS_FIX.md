# ‚úÖ CONTROLS & CAMERA-RELATIVE MOVEMENT - FIXED

## üéØ **WHAT WAS WRONG**

### **ISSUE #1: Wrong Input System** ‚ùå
**Problem:** Using `Input.GetAxisRaw()` instead of your Controls system
**Result:** Not respecting your custom key bindings

### **ISSUE #2: World-Space Movement** ‚ùå
**Problem:** Movement was in world directions (N/S/E/W) instead of camera-relative
**Result:** Confusing controls - W didn't move "forward" relative to camera view

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT'S FIXED**

### **Fix #1: Uses YOUR Controls System**

```csharp
// OLD CODE (WRONG - generic input):
float rawX = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal"); // A/D keys
float rawZ = Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical");   // W/S keys

// NEW CODE (CORRECT - your Controls):
if (Input.GetKey(Controls.MoveForward)) rawZ += 1f;
if (Input.GetKey(Controls.MoveBackward)) rawZ -= 1f;
if (Input.GetKey(Controls.MoveLeft)) rawX -= 1f;
if (Input.GetKey(Controls.MoveRight)) rawX += 1f;
```

**Result:** Now uses your Controls.cs key bindings (W/A/S/D by default, or whatever you set)

### **Fix #2: Camera-Relative Movement**

```csharp
// OLD CODE (WRONG - world space):
Vector3 forward = Vector3.forward;  // Always North
Vector3 right = Vector3.right;      // Always East

// NEW CODE (CORRECT - camera relative):
forward = bleedOutCamera.transform.forward;
forward.y = 0f;
forward.Normalize();

right = bleedOutCamera.transform.right;
right.y = 0f;
right.Normalize();
```

**Result:** Movement is now relative to camera view direction

---

## üéÆ **HOW IT WORKS NOW**

### **Controls:**
- Uses **Controls.MoveForward** (default: W)
- Uses **Controls.MoveBackward** (default: S)
- Uses **Controls.MoveLeft** (default: A)
- Uses **Controls.MoveRight** (default: D)

**If you change keys in Controls.cs or InputSettings, bleeding out movement will use those keys!**

### **Movement Direction:**

```
         üé• Camera
         (Looking this way)
              ‚Üì
              
    A ‚Üê  üë§ Player  ‚Üí D
         ‚Üë     ‚Üì
         W     S
         
Movement is RELATIVE TO CAMERA VIEW:
- W = Forward (where camera is looking)
- S = Backward (away from camera view)
- A = Left (relative to camera)
- D = Right (relative to camera)
```

**Example:**
- Camera behind player looking North ‚Üí W moves North
- Camera rotates to look East ‚Üí W now moves East
- **Movement always feels "forward" relative to camera!**

## ‚úÖ **WHAT YOU GET**

### **1. Correct Input System** ‚úÖ
- Uses your Controls.cs system
- Respects custom key bindings
- Consistent with rest of game

### **2. Camera-Relative Movement** ‚úÖ
- W = Forward relative to camera view
- S = Backward relative to camera view
- A/D = Left/Right relative to camera view
- Intuitive third-person controls

### **3. Smooth Camera Follow** ‚úÖ
- Camera follows from behind and above
- Camera rotates to stay behind player
- Movement direction updates as camera rotates

---

## üß™ **TEST IT**

1. **Enter Play Mode**
2. **Take damage until bleeding out**
3. **Press W (MoveForward):**
   - ‚úÖ Should move in direction camera is facing
   - ‚úÖ Camera follows from behind
4. **Press A (MoveLeft):**
   - ‚úÖ Should move left relative to camera view
   - ‚úÖ Camera rotates to follow
5. **Press D (MoveRight):**
   - ‚úÖ Should move right relative to camera view
   - ‚úÖ Camera rotates to follow
6. **Press S (MoveBackward):**
   - ‚úÖ Should move backward relative to camera view
   - ‚úÖ Camera follows

## üìä **BEHAVIOR COMPARISON**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Camera looking North
Press W ‚Üí Move North (world space)
Camera rotates to East
Press W ‚Üí Still move North (WRONG!)
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Camera looking North
Press W ‚Üí Move North (camera forward)
Camera rotates to East
Press W ‚Üí Now move East (CORRECT!)
```

**Movement always feels natural relative to camera view!**

## üíé **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Input System:**
- Reads from `Controls.MoveForward`, `MoveBackward`, `MoveLeft`, `MoveRight`
- Uses `Input.GetKey()` for direct key detection
- Normalizes diagonal movement for consistent speed

### **Movement Calculation:**
1. Get camera's forward direction
2. Flatten to ground plane (remove Y component)
3. Normalize to unit vector
4. Calculate movement: `(forward * input.y + right * input.x)`
5. Scale by crawl speed
6. Apply to CharacterController

### **Camera Follow:**
- Camera positioned behind and above player
- Camera rotation follows player's forward direction
- Smooth lerp for camera position
- Fixed pitch angle from Inspector

---

## üéØ **FINAL RESULT**

**Input:** Uses YOUR Controls system (W/A/S/D or custom keys)  
**Movement:** Relative to camera view direction  
**Feel:** Natural third-person controls  
**Camera:** Follows from behind and above  

**Exactly what you wanted!** üõ°Ô∏è

## üìù **NOTES**

### **Changing Key Bindings:**

If you want to change the bleeding out movement keys:

1. Open `Controls.cs`
2. Change the key bindings:
   ```csharp
   public static KeyCode MoveForward { get; private set; } = KeyCode.W;
   ```
3. Bleeding out movement will automatically use new keys!

### **Movement Speed:**

Adjust in Inspector:
- **Crawl Speed:** 2.5 (slow crawling)
- Higher = faster crawling
- Lower = slower crawling

### **Camera Behavior:**

Adjust in Inspector:
- **Camera Height:** 500 (distance from player)
- **Pitch Angle:** 20 (angle looking down)
- **Follow Smoothness:** 8 (camera follow speed)
