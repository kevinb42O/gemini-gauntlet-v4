# 🔥 Hand Overheat System - Polish Complete

## Summary
Fixed critical particle effect bug and added comprehensive sound feedback system for hand overheat mechanics.

## 🐛 Bug Fix: Left Hand Overheat Particles

### Problem
- **Right hand** overheat particles worked perfectly ✅
- **Left hand** overheat particles never showed ❌
- UI and heat tracking worked correctly for both hands

### Root Cause
**Inverted parameters in `HandUIManager.cs` line 1098-1134**

The `RefreshParticleEffects()` method had the `isPrimaryHand` parameter backwards:
- When **left hand** overheated → called `ActivateOverheatParticles(false, true)` → activated **RIGHT** hand particles
- When **right hand** overheated → called `ActivateOverheatParticles(true, true)` → activated **LEFT** hand particles

### Fix Applied
**File:** `Assets/scripts/HandUIManager.cs`

Corrected all particle activation calls in `RefreshParticleEffects()`:
```csharp
// LEFT HAND (Primary = true)
if (leftOverheated)
{
    ActivateHeatWarningParticles(true, false);  // FIXED: was false
    ActivateOverheatParticles(true, true);      // FIXED: was false
}

// RIGHT HAND (Secondary = false)  
if (rightOverheated)
{
    ActivateHeatWarningParticles(false, false); // FIXED: was true
    ActivateOverheatParticles(false, true);     // FIXED: was true
}
```

**Result:** Both hands now correctly display their overheat particle effects! 🎉

## 🔊 Sound System Integration

### New Sound Events Added
**File:** `Assets/scripts/Audio/FIXSOUNDSCRIPTS/SoundEvents.cs`

Added 4 new assignable sound events under **"► PLAYER: Hand Overheat"** section:

| Sound Event | Trigger | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `handHeat50Warning` | 50% heat | Moderate warning - "Hey, watch your heat!" |
| `handHeatHighWarning` | 70% heat | Critical warning - "Danger zone!" |
| `handOverheated` | 100% heat | Critical failure - "You've overheated!" |
| `handOverheatedBlocked` | Blocked shot | Feedback - "Can't shoot, hand is overheated!" |

### Sound Integration
**File:** `Assets/scripts/PlayerOverheatManager.cs`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Added SoundEvents reference** (line 10-12)
   ```csharp
   [Header("Sound Events")]
   [Tooltip("Reference to SoundEvents asset for overheat audio feedback")]
   public SoundEvents soundEvents;
   ```

2. **Added sound tracking flags** (line 58-62)
   - Prevents sound spam by tracking which alerts have been played
   - Resets when heat drops below threshold

3. **Enhanced `HandleHeatWarning()`** (line 210-250)
   - Plays 50% warning sound at moderate heat
   - Plays 70% warning sound at high heat threshold
   - Automatically resets flags when heat decreases

4. **Added sound to `TriggerFullOverheatConsequences()`** (line 257-258)
   - Plays critical overheat sound at 100%

5. **Added blocked shot feedback in `CanFire()`** (line 319-323)
   - Plays blocked sound when player tries to shoot overheated hand
   - Provides immediate audio feedback for blocked action

6. **Added helper method `PlayOverheatSound()`** (line 573-582)
   - Null-safe sound playback
   - Handles missing sound assignments gracefully

## 🎮 How to Set Up in Unity

### 1. Assign Sound Clips
1. Open your **SoundEvents** ScriptableObject asset
2. Navigate to **"► PLAYER: Hand Overheat"** section
3. Assign audio clips to:
   - `handHeat50Warning` - Subtle beep/alert
   - `handHeatHighWarning` - Urgent warning tone
   - `handOverheated` - Critical alarm/failure sound
   - `handOverheatedBlocked` - Denied/error sound (like UI click denied)

### 2. Assign SoundEvents to PlayerOverheatManager
1. Select your **PlayerOverheatManager** GameObject in scene
2. In Inspector, find **"Sound Events"** field at top
3. Drag your **SoundEvents** asset into this field

### 3. Test It!
- Fire continuously with one hand to build heat
- Listen for sound alerts at 50%, 70%, and 100%
- Try shooting when overheated to hear blocked sound
- Verify **both hands** show particle effects correctly

## 🎯 Sound Design Recommendations

### 50% Warning (`handHeat50Warning`)
- **Tone:** Informative, not alarming
- **Volume:** Medium-low
- **Example:** Single beep, subtle alert chime
- **Purpose:** "You're halfway there, be aware"

### 70% Warning (`handHeatHighWarning`)
- **Tone:** Urgent, attention-grabbing
- **Volume:** Medium-high
- **Example:** Rapid beeps, rising pitch, warning klaxon
- **Purpose:** "DANGER! Back off now!"

### 100% Overheat (`handOverheated`)
- **Tone:** Critical failure, dramatic
- **Volume:** High
- **Example:** Alarm, explosion, system failure sound
- **Purpose:** "You messed up, hand is down!"

### Blocked Shot (`handOverheatedBlocked`)
- **Tone:** Denied, error feedback
- **Volume:** Medium
- **Example:** Error buzz, denied click, "nope" sound
- **Purpose:** "Can't do that right now"

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Particle Effect Mapping
```
Primary Hand (isPrimary=true)   = LEFT hand  (LMB)
Secondary Hand (isPrimary=false) = RIGHT hand (RMB)
```

### Sound Trigger Logic
```
Heat 0-49%:  No sounds
Heat 50%:    Play handHeat50Warning (once)
Heat 70%+:   Play handHeatHighWarning (once)
Heat 100%:   Play handOverheated + trigger forced cooldown
Blocked:     Play handOverheatedBlocked (each attempt)
```

### Sound Flag Reset
- Flags reset when heat drops below threshold
- Allows sounds to replay if player heats up again
- Prevents spam during continuous heat buildup
