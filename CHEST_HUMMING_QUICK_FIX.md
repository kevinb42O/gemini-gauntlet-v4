# 🚨 CHEST HUMMING - QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING

## 🎯 You're hearing NO humming? Follow these steps EXACTLY:

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Find Your Chest in the Scene

1. In Unity Hierarchy, find your chest GameObject
2. Select it
3. Look at the Inspector panel

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Check ChestSoundManager Component

In the Inspector, you should see a **ChestSoundManager** component.

### If you DON'T see it:
1. Click "Add Component"
2. Type "ChestSoundManager"
3. Add it

### If you DO see it:
Look for the **"Fallback Humming Clip"** field:
- **If it's empty**: Drag your `chestSFX_TRY2` audio clip into this field
- **If it has a clip**: Good! Continue to Step 3

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Use Debug Context Menu (IMPORTANT!)

With your chest selected in the Hierarchy:

### A) Check Current Status:
1. Right-click on **ChestSoundManager** component
2. Click **"🔍 TEST: Check Audio Status"**
3. Look at the Console - it will tell you EXACTLY what's wrong

### B) Force Start Humming:
1. Right-click on **ChestSoundManager** component
2. Click **"🎵 TEST: Start Humming NOW"**
3. You should hear the sound immediately!

### C) If still no sound:
1. Right-click on **ChestController** component
2. Click **"🎵 TEST: Force Closed State (Start Humming)"**
3. This forces the chest into the correct state

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Check Console Messages

After using the debug commands, check the Console for messages:

### ✅ GOOD Messages:
```
[ChestSoundManager] ✅ Started chest humming (FALLBACK) at ChestName
```
or
```
[ChestSoundManager] ✅ Started chest humming (ADVANCED) at ChestName
```

### ❌ BAD Messages (and fixes):

#### "❌ NO AUDIO CLIP AVAILABLE"
**FIX**: Assign `chestSFX_TRY2` to the `Fallback Humming Clip` field

#### "❌ Fallback AudioSource is NULL"
**FIX**: Delete the ChestSoundManager component and add it again

#### "ChestSoundManager is NULL"
**FIX**: Add the ChestSoundManager component to your chest

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Check Your Audio Clip Settings

1. Select `chestSFX_TRY2` in your Project window
2. In Inspector, make sure:
   - ✅ **Load Type**: Decompress On Load (or Streaming)
   - ✅ **Preload Audio Data**: Checked
   - ✅ **Load In Background**: Unchecked

---

## ✅ STEP 6: Check Chest State

Your chest must be in **Closed** state for humming to play.

1. Select your chest
2. Look at **ChestController** component
3. Find **"Current State"** field
4. It should say **"Closed"**

### If it says "Hidden" or something else:
1. Right-click on **ChestController**
2. Click **"🎵 TEST: Force Closed State (Start Humming)"**

---

## ✅ STEP 7: Check Audio Listener

1. Find your **Player** or **Main Camera** in the scene
2. Make sure it has an **Audio Listener** component
3. There should only be ONE Audio Listener in the scene

---

## 🎮 STEP 8: Test In Play Mode

1. **Enter Play Mode**
2. **Walk near the chest**
3. You should hear humming!

### Still no sound in Play Mode?
1. **While in Play Mode**, select your chest
2. Right-click on ChestSoundManager
3. Click **"🎵 TEST: Start Humming NOW"**
4. Check Console for error messages

---

## 🔧 NUCLEAR OPTION: Complete Reset

If NOTHING works:

1. **Stop Play Mode**
2. Select your chest GameObject
3. **Remove** the ChestSoundManager component
4. **Remove** the ChestController component
5. **Add back** ChestController component
6. **Add back** ChestSoundManager component
7. **Assign** `chestSFX_TRY2` to **Fallback Humming Clip**
8. Set **Current State** to **Closed**
9. **Enter Play Mode**
10. Right-click ChestSoundManager → **"🎵 TEST: Start Humming NOW"**
