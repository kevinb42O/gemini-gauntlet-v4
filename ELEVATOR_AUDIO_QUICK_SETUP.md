  └─ Elevator Music: [Your muzak/jazz] ← NEW! Background music
```

### **Step 2: Adjust Settings (Optional)**
```
Audio Settings:
  ├─ Music Start Distance: 50.0 ← How far music is heard
  ├─ Music Full Volume Distance: 20.0 ← Full volume range

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Music doesn't play:**
- ✅ Check music clip is assigned
- ✅ Check player has "Player" tag
- ✅ Check distance (within 50 units?)

**Movement sound doesn't stop:**
- ✅ Already fixed! Should work now.
- ✅ Enable debug logs to see "🔇 Movement sound STOPPED"

**Music too loud/quiet:**
- ✅ Adjust `Music Volume` slider (0-1 range)
