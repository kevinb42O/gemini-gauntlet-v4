## 💡 **CORE PRINCIPLES**

### 1. **Small Wins Compound**
One checkbox per day = 7 tasks per week = 28 tasks per month = shippable demo

### 2. **Done > Perfect**
A finished, imperfect game beats a perfect, unfinished game. Always.

### 3. **Rest Is Part of Work**
Burnout kills games. Take breaks. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

### 4. **You're Not Alone**
Thousands of indie devs struggle with the "finishing" phase. You're normal.

### 5. **The Only Failure Is Stopping**
Every shipped game was once an overwhelming project. They finished because someone didn't quit.
