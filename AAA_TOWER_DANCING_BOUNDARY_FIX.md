# Tower Dancing Boundary Fix - Complete

## Problem
Towers were dancing (moving randomly) without respecting their platform boundaries. They could move off the platform or into invalid positions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Platform Boundary Detection**
- Towers now query their associated `PlatformTrigger` to get the platform's collider bounds
- All dance positions are validated against these bounds before being selected
- Added a 2-unit safety margin to keep towers well within the platform edges

### 2. **First Move Behavior**
- **New Rule**: The first dance move after emergence now prefers moving towards the center of the platform
- Towers move 60-80% of the way towards the platform center on their first move
- This ensures towers that spawn near edges move inward first, staying safe

### 3. **Subsequent Moves**
- All subsequent dance moves are validated to stay within platform bounds
- Up to 10 attempts are made to find a valid position
- Positions are checked in world space against the platform trigger's bounds
- If no valid position is found after 10 attempts, the tower stays at its current position

### 4. **Collision Avoidance**
- Maintained existing collision detection with other towers (5-unit minimum distance)
- Combined with boundary checking for comprehensive position validation

## Code Changes

### File: `TowerController.cs`

#### Added Field (Line 88)
```csharp
protected bool _isFirstDanceMove = true; // Track if this is the first move after emergence
```

#### Updated `StartDancingAfterWait()` (Line 616)
```csharp
_isFirstDanceMove = true; // Reset first move flag
```

#### Completely Rewrote `PickNewDancingTarget()` (Lines 625-726)
- Added platform trigger and bounds detection
- Implemented first-move-towards-center logic
- Added comprehensive boundary validation with safety margins
- Improved fallback behavior when platform not found

#### Updated `StartCollapseSequence()` (Line 1081)
```csharp
_isFirstDanceMove = true; // Reset for potential respawn
```

## Benefits

✅ **Towers never leave their platform** - All positions validated against platform bounds  
✅ **First move is safer** - Towers spawn near edges move inward first  
✅ **2-unit safety margin** - Towers stay well away from platform edges  
✅ **Graceful fallback** - If no valid position found, tower stays put instead of moving off-platform  
✅ **Debug logging** - Clear logs show when towers pick positions and why  

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Edge Spawning**: Place towers near platform edges and verify they move inward first
2. **Small Platforms**: Test on small platforms to ensure boundary detection works
3. **Multiple Towers**: Spawn multiple towers to verify collision avoidance still works
4. **Large Platforms**: Verify towers still dance freely on large platforms
5. **No Platform**: Test fallback behavior when platform trigger is missing

## Technical Notes

- Uses `Collider.bounds` in world space for accurate boundary detection
- Converts between local and world space properly for parent-child relationships
- Safety margin of 2 units prevents towers from getting too close to edges
- Maximum 10 attempts to find valid position prevents infinite loops
- First move flag resets on both emergence and collapse for clean state management
