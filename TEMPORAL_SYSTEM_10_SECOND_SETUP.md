## Controls (You Already Know These)

| Key | Effect | Trail Color |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| W/A/S/D | Move | Green (walk) |
| Shift + Move | Sprint | Orange (fire) |
| Ctrl | Crouch | Blue (ice) |
| Space | Jump | Yellow (lightning) |

**No new controls. Just move normally.**

## Visual Indicators

### You'll Know It's Working When:

âœ… Colored spheres appear behind you (trails)
âœ… Trails glow and emit particles
âœ… When you cross a trail, it EXPLODES (resonance)
âœ… Ghostly blue versions of you appear and move around
âœ… Top-left shows: "ðŸ‘» Temporal Echoes Active: X"

---

## Quick Test (30 Seconds)

1. Press Play
2. Sprint in a circle (Shift + W + Mouse)
3. Jump through the center (Spacebar)
4. **BOOM** - Resonance burst + Echo spawns
5. Do it again
6. Watch as multiple ghosts replay your movements
7. **MIND = BLOWN**

---

## Troubleshooting (If Needed)

### No trails appearing?
- Make sure MomentumPainter is attached
- Move faster (sprint)
- Check "Min Movement Speed" is 0.1 or less

### No echoes spawning?
- Make sure TemporalEchoSystem is attached  
- Make sure TemporalEchoConnector is attached
- Cross your trails more (create resonance bursts)

### Performance issues?
- Reduce "Max Active Echoes" to 5 (default is 10)
- Reduce "Pool Size" in MomentumPainter to 50

---

## Advanced: Optional Tweaks

### Want More Echoes?
`Temporal Echo System â†’ Max Active Echoes = 20`

### Want Echoes to Last Longer?
`Temporal Echo System â†’ Echo Lifetime = 15`

### Want More Damage from Echoes?
`Temporal Echo System â†’ Echo Damage Multiplier = 1.0` (100% of your damage)

### Want Guaranteed Echo Spawns?
`Temporal Echo Connector â†’ Resonance Echo Chance = 1.0` (100% spawn rate)
