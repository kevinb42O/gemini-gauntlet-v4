## Quick Setup (Unity Editor)

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)
1. **Create Keycards**: Assets â†’ Create â†’ Keycard System â†’ All 5 Keycards
2. **Create Scene Objects**: GameObject â†’ Keycard System â†’ Create Complete Keycard Set
3. **Assign Keycards**: Drag ScriptableObjects to pickups and doors
4. **Add to Chests**: Find ChestInteractionSystem â†’ Add keycards to Possible Items
5. **Test**: Enter Play Mode and test!

### Manual Setup
See **KEYCARD_SYSTEM_SETUP_GUIDE.md** for detailed instructions

---

## How Players Use It

### Finding Keycards
1. **World Pickups**: Walk near keycard â†’ Press E â†’ Collected
2. **Chest Loot**: Open chest â†’ Drag keycard to inventory â†’ Collected

### Using Keycards
1. Walk near door requiring keycard
2. If you have keycard: "Press E to open with [Keycard Name]"
3. If you don't have keycard: "Requires [Keycard Name]"
4. Press E to open door (consumes keycard)
5. Door opens with animation

## Testing Checklist

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Create 5 keycard ScriptableObjects
- [ ] Create keycard pickups in scene (optional)
- [ ] Create doors with keycard requirements
- [ ] Add keycards to ChestInteractionSystem

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test world pickup collection
- [ ] Test chest loot spawning
- [ ] Test door interaction without keycard
- [ ] Test door interaction with keycard
- [ ] Verify keycard consumption
- [ ] Test door animations
- [ ] Verify audio feedback
- [ ] Check UI prompts

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with full inventory
- [ ] Test multiple keycards of same type
- [ ] Test wrong keycard on door
- [ ] Test door auto-close (if enabled)
- [ ] Test collecting from chest multiple times

---

## Customization Options

### Easy Customizations (No Code)
- Change keycard colors and icons
- Adjust door animation types and speeds
- Modify collection distances
- Change spawn rates in chests
- Add custom audio clips
- Adjust visual effects (bobbing, rotation)

### Advanced Customizations (Code)
- Add multiple keycards per door
- Make keycards reusable (not consumed)
- Add keycard durability system
- Create keycard crafting recipes
- Add keycard trading system
- Implement keycard security levels

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Keycard Not Collecting
**Problem**: Can't collect keycard from world or chest  
**Solution**: Check InventoryManager exists, inventory not full, player has "Player" tag

### Door Not Opening
**Problem**: Have keycard but door won't open  
**Solution**: Verify Required Keycard is assigned, keycard is in inventory, correct keycard type

### Keycards Not in Chests
**Problem**: Opened many chests, no keycards  
**Solution**: Add keycards to ChestInteractionSystem Possible Items, increase spawn rate

### Visual Effects Not Working
**Problem**: Keycard not bobbing/rotating  
**Solution**: Enable visual effects in KeycardItem component, check Update is running

---

## Performance Notes

### Optimized For
- Multiple keycards in scene simultaneously
- Multiple doors checking for keycards
- Chest loot generation with many items
- Frequent inventory checks

### Best Practices
- Disable keycards/doors that are far from player
- Use object pooling for many keycard pickups
- Limit number of active doors checking for player
- Cache component references

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Features
- [ ] Keycard duplication system
- [ ] Master keycard (opens all doors)
- [ ] Temporary keycard access (time-limited)
- [ ] Keycard hacking minigame
- [ ] Keycard security levels (clearance system)
- [ ] Keycard trading with NPCs
- [ ] Keycard crafting from materials
- [ ] Keycard upgrade system

### Integration Ideas
- [ ] Mission system (collect X keycards)
- [ ] Achievement system (find all keycards)
- [ ] Lore system (keycard descriptions)
- [ ] Map markers for keycard locations
- [ ] Keycard detector item
