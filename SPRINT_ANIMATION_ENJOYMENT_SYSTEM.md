    // Unlock the hand
    handState.isLocked = false;
    handState.isSoftLocked = false;
    
    // Movement system automatically resumes sprint!
    // Sprint animation returns naturally ✅
}
```

### **Special Interrupt Rule:**
```csharp
// SPECIAL CASE: Brief combat can interrupt sprint
if (currentState == HandAnimationState.Sprint && IsBriefCombatInterrupt(newState))
{
    TransitionToState(handState, newState, isLeftHand); // Allow interrupt
    return; // Auto-return handled by coroutine
}
