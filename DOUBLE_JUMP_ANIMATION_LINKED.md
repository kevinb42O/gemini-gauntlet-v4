# 🚀🚀 DOUBLE JUMP ANIMATION - LINKED!

## ✅ What Was Done

Double jump now plays the **exact same animation** as regular jump - no need to create a separate animation!

### Code Added:
```csharp
// In AAAMovementController.cs - Double Jump Input Handler
if (Input.GetKeyDown(Controls.UpThrustJump) && airJumpRemaining > 0)
{
    velocity.y = Mathf.Sqrt(doubleJumpForce * -2f * gravity);
    airJumpRemaining--;
    
    GameSounds.PlayPlayerDoubleJump(transform.position);
    
    // NEW: Trigger jump animation for double jump!
    if (_animationStateManager != null)
    {
        _animationStateManager.SetMovementState(Jump);
        Debug.Log("🚀🚀 [DOUBLE JUMP] Jump animation triggered!");
    }
}
```

## 🎮 How It Works

### Regular Jump:
```
Press Space → Jump animation plays → Unlock when grounded
```

### Double Jump:
```
Press Space again in air → Same jump animation plays → Unlock when grounded
```

**Same animation used for both!** ✅

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Test: Double Jump Animation
1. Press **Space** to jump
2. **Jump animation plays** (first jump)
3. While in air, press **Space** again
4. **Jump animation plays again** (double jump!)
5. Land on ground
6. Animation unlocks, sprint/walk/idle resumes

### Console Logs:
```
🚀 [JUMP] ANIMATION TRIGGERED! Lock for 0.6s | Previous: Sprint
🚀🚀 [DOUBLE JUMP] Jump animation triggered! (Same animation as regular jump)
⚡ [INSTANT UNLOCK] Jump unlocked - GROUNDED!
⚡ [INSTANT SPRINT] Sprint resumed INSTANTLY
```

## ⚙️ Enabling Double Jump

Double jump is **currently DISABLED** by default. To enable:

### In Unity Inspector:
1. Select **Player GameObject**
2. Find **AAAMovementController** component
3. Expand **"=== JUMPING ==="** section
4. Set **"Max Air Jumps"** to **1** (or higher for triple jump, etc.)

### Settings:
- `maxAirJumps = 0` → No double jump (default)
- `maxAirJumps = 1` → Double jump enabled ✅
- `maxAirJumps = 2` → Triple jump enabled
- `maxAirJumps = 3` → Quad jump enabled

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Animation Flow:
```
Regular Jump:
  Space pressed → Jump animation → Ground check → Unlock
  
Double Jump:
  Space pressed in air → Jump animation → Ground check → Unlock
  
Same system, same animation, same unlock logic!
```

### Ground-Based Unlock:
Both regular and double jump use the **same grounded unlock system**:
```csharp
if (currentState == Jump && movementController.IsGrounded)
{
    // Unlock immediately when grounded!
    isPlayingOneShotAnimation = false;
    // Sprint/Walk/Idle can resume
}
```

This means:
- ✅ Jump unlocks when you land
- ✅ Double jump unlocks when you land
- ✅ Triple jump unlocks when you land
- ✅ All use same animation
- ✅ All unlock instantly on landing

## 🎨 Animation Reuse Benefits

### Why This Works:
1. **No duplicate animations needed** - Saves time and file size
2. **Consistent visual** - Player sees same motion every jump
3. **Easy maintenance** - One animation to update/tweak
4. **Instant setup** - Already works with existing jump animation

### If You Want Different Animation Later:
If you ever want a unique double jump animation, you can:
1. Create new `DoubleJump` state in `PlayerAnimationState` enum
2. Add animation in Unity Animator
3. Change the call from `Jump` to `DoubleJump` in the double jump code

But for now, **reusing the same animation is perfect!** ✅

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Regular Jump
```
Press Space → Jump animation plays ✅
Land → Animation unlocks ✅
Sprint resumes ✅
```

### Test 2: Double Jump (If Enabled)
```
Press Space → Jump animation plays
Press Space in air → Jump animation plays again! ✅
Land → Animation unlocks ✅
Sprint resumes ✅
```

### Test 3: Sprint → Double Jump → Sprint
```
Sprint with Shift + W
Press Space → Jump
Press Space in air → Jump again
Keep holding Shift + W
Land → Sprint resumes INSTANTLY! ✅
```

## 📊 Animation State Transitions

### Single Jump Flow:
```
Sprint → Jump (Space) → In Air → Land → Sprint
```

### Double Jump Flow:
```
Sprint → Jump (Space) → In Air → Jump Again (Space) → Still In Air → Land → Sprint
         └─ Same anim ─┘         └─── Same anim ───┘
```

**Animation plays twice, uses same clip!** ✅

## 🎯 Summary

✅ **Double jump now plays jump animation**  
✅ **No separate animation needed**  
✅ **Works with grounded instant unlock**  
✅ **Sprint resumes perfectly after landing**  
✅ **Console logs show clear tracking**
