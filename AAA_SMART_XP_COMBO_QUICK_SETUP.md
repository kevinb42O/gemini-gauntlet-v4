## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "I see 5 yellow texts overlapping!"
→ **Check:** Is "Enable Kill Combo" checked in inspector?

### "Combos don't trigger!"
→ **Check:** Are you killing enemies within 2.5 seconds?

### "Text is too small!"
→ **Adjust:** Increase "Combo Size Multipliers" values

### "Multipliers too weak!"
→ **Adjust:** Increase "Combo Multipliers" values
