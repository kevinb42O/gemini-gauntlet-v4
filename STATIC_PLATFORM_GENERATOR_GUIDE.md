# üéÆ STATIC TIER PLATFORM GENERATOR - SETUP GUIDE
## Create Your Vertical Roguelike Levels in 5 Minutes

---

## üì¶ **WHAT YOU JUST GOT**

Two new scripts that work together:
1. **`StaticTierPlatformGenerator.cs`** - Main component (attach to empty GameObject)
2. **`StaticTierPlatformGeneratorEditor.cs`** - Inspector GUI (in Editor folder)

**What it does:**
- Spawns platforms at different heights (tiers)
- Platforms are STATIC (no movement at all)
- Spawns in EDITOR (not at runtime)
- Clones OrbitalSystem wisdom but adapted for static gameplay
- You manually place elevators after generation

---

## üöÄ **QUICK START (5-Minute Setup)**

### Step 1: Create the Generator (30 seconds)
1. In your scene, create empty GameObject (right-click Hierarchy ‚Üí Create Empty)
2. Rename it: **"Platform Generator"**
3. Add component: `StaticTierPlatformGenerator`
4. Done!

---

### Step 2: Configure Your Tiers (2 minutes)

**In the Inspector:**

#### **Tier 1 - Normal (Space Theme)**
```
Tier Name: "Normal Platforms"
Platform Prefab: [Drag your space platform prefab here]
Platform Count: 5
Theme Tag: "Space"
```

#### **Tier 2 - Ice**
```
Tier Name: "Ice Platforms"
Platform Prefab: [Drag your ice platform prefab here]
Platform Count: 5
Theme Tag: "Ice"
```

#### **Tier 3 - Fire**
```
Tier Name: "Fire Platforms"
Platform Prefab: [Drag your fire platform prefab here]
Platform Count: 5
Theme Tag: "Fire"
```

---

### Step 3: Set Spacing (30 seconds)

**In the Inspector:**
```
Platform Spacing: 150 (how far apart platforms are horizontally)
Tier Height Offset: 300 (vertical distance between tiers)
Starting Height: 0 (Y position of first tier)
Layout Pattern: Circle (platforms arranged in a circle)
```

**Preview:**
- Tier 1 (Normal): Y = 0
- Tier 2 (Ice): Y = 300
- Tier 3 (Fire): Y = 600

---

### Step 4: Generate! (5 seconds)

1. Click the BIG GREEN BUTTON: **"üöÄ GENERATE PLATFORMS"**
2. Confirm dialog
3. Watch the magic happen!

**Result:**
- 15 platforms spawned (5 per tier)
- Organized in hierarchy:
  ```
  Platform Generator
    ‚îú‚îÄ Tier_1_Normal Platforms
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Platform_1_Normal Platforms
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Platform_2_Normal Platforms
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Platform_3_Normal Platforms
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Platform_4_Normal Platforms
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Platform_5_Normal Platforms
    ‚îú‚îÄ Tier_2_Ice Platforms
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ (5 ice platforms...)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Tier_3_Fire Platforms
        ‚îî‚îÄ (5 fire platforms...)
  ```

---

### Step 5: Place Elevators Manually (2 minutes)

1. **Find an elevator prefab** (you have `ElevatorController` in your scripts)
2. **Drag elevator onto a platform** in Tier 1
3. **In elevator Inspector, set:**
   - `Top Floor Position`: Create empty GameObject on Tier 2 platform (where elevator goes UP to)
   - `Bottom Floor Position`: Create empty GameObject on current platform (where elevator starts)
4. **Repeat for other platforms** that need elevators
5. **Test:** Walk onto elevator, should transport you up!

---

## üé® **LAYOUT PATTERNS EXPLAINED**

### Circle (Recommended)
```
Platforms arranged in a ring
Perfect for 360¬∞ exploration
Player must search for elevator platform
```

### Grid
```
Platforms in rows/columns
Easier to navigate
Good for structured gameplay
```

### Line
```
Platforms in a straight line
Linear progression
Simple layout
```

### Random
```
Scattered placement
More exploration
Unpredictable paths
```

---

## üîß **ADVANCED CONFIGURATION**

### Change Number of Platforms Per Tier
```
In Inspector ‚Üí Tiers ‚Üí Tier 1 ‚Üí Platform Count: 5
Change to: 10 (more platforms = more exploration)
```

### Adjust Height Between Tiers
```
Tier Height Offset: 300
Change to: 500 (taller = more dramatic elevator rides)
```

### Change Platform Spread
```
Platform Spacing: 150
Change to: 300 (wider spread = more space to traverse)
```

---

## üéÆ **GAMEPLAY FLOW**

**What the player experiences:**

```
1. Start on Platform 1 (Tier 1 - Normal/Space theme)
2. Fight enemies, loot chests
3. Use movement (wall-jump, slide) to reach other platforms
4. Find platform with elevator
5. Ride elevator UP to Tier 2 (Ice theme)
6. Platforms are at Y = 300 now
7. Ice platforms have different enemies/visuals
8. Find elevator again
9. Ride to Tier 3 (Fire theme) at Y = 600
10. Repeat with increasing difficulty
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### "Generate Platforms button does nothing"
- Make sure both scripts are in correct folders:
  - `StaticTierPlatformGenerator.cs` ‚Üí Assets/scripts/
  - `StaticTierPlatformGeneratorEditor.cs` ‚Üí Assets/scripts/Editor/

### "Platforms spawn but no colliders"
- Script automatically adds BoxCollider
- Check your prefab has MeshRenderer

### "Elevator doesn't work"
- Make sure ElevatorController has:
  - `topFloorPosition` = Empty GameObject on HIGHER platform
  - `bottomFloorPosition` = Empty GameObject on LOWER platform
  - Check `ElevatorController.cs` line 1-150 for proper setup

### "Platforms are moving"
- They shouldn't be! Script removes CelestialPlatform component
- Check Inspector: No Rigidbody, no CelestialPlatform
- Platforms marked as Static = true

### "Want to regenerate with different settings"
1. Click "üóëÔ∏è Clear Generated Platforms" (red button)
2. Change settings in Inspector
3. Click "üöÄ GENERATE PLATFORMS" again

## üí° **TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS**

### Tip 1: Platform Prefab Setup
Your platform prefab should have:
- ‚úÖ MeshRenderer (so you can see it)
- ‚úÖ Collider (so player can land on it) - auto-added if missing
- ‚úÖ EnemySpawner script (if you want enemies)
- ‚úÖ Chest spawn points (if you want loot)

### Tip 2: Elevator Placement Strategy
**Don't put elevators on every platform!**
- Only 1-2 elevators per tier
- Forces player to explore to find them
- Rewards movement mastery (wall-jumping between platforms)

### Tip 3: Visual Distinction
Make each tier LOOK different:
- **Tier 1:** Dark metal with cyan glow (space theme)
- **Tier 2:** Blue ice crystals (ice theme)
- **Tier 3:** Red lava cracks (fire theme)
- Player instantly knows which tier they're on

### Tip 4: Difficulty Scaling
Use `TierIdentifier` component for gameplay:
```csharp
// In your enemy spawner or game logic:
TierIdentifier tier = platform.GetComponent<TierIdentifier>();
if (tier.tierIndex == 0) 
{
    // Tier 1: Spawn 5 basic enemies
}
else if (tier.tierIndex == 1) 
{
    // Tier 2: Spawn 8 medium enemies
}
else if (tier.tierIndex == 2) 
{
    // Tier 3: Spawn 10 hard enemies + 1 mini-boss
}
```

## üéØ **PERFORMANCE NOTES**

### Why This is Optimized:

‚úÖ **Static Platforms**
- Marked `isStatic = true`
- Unity batches them (1 draw call for multiple platforms)
- No physics calculations (no Rigidbody)

‚úÖ **No Runtime Generation**
- Spawns in Editor, not at runtime
- Zero CPU overhead during gameplay
- What you see in editor = what player sees

‚úÖ **Simple Colliders**
- BoxCollider only (cheapest collision)
- No mesh colliders
- No unnecessary triggers

‚úÖ **Elevator System**
- Your ElevatorController is already optimized
- Smart player parenting (no physics jank)
- Can have multiple elevators in scene with zero conflict

**Expected Performance:**
- 15 static platforms = <0.1ms frame time
- 50 static platforms = <0.5ms frame time
- 100+ platforms = still runs at 60 FPS!

  ‚Üì Find elevator platform
  ‚Üì Ride UP
Arrive at Tier 2 (Ice)
  ‚Üì New theme, harder enemies
  ‚Üì Explore, fight, loot
  ‚Üì Find elevator
  ‚Üì Ride UP
Arrive at Tier 3 (Fire)
  ‚Üì Hardest tier
  ‚Üì Boss platform?
  ‚Üì Repeat or add more tiers!
```

## üí¨ **FAQ**

**Q: Can I mix orbital platforms and static platforms?**
A: Yes! Use `UniverseGenerator` for moving platforms in some areas, `StaticTierPlatformGenerator` for static tiers in others.

**Q: Can I have more than 3 tiers?**
A: Absolutely! Add as many as you want. Just increase the Tiers list size.

**Q: Can I regenerate without losing my elevator placements?**
A: No - elevators are parented to platforms. Save elevator settings before regenerating, or place elevators AFTER finalizing layout.

**Q: What if I want platforms to move?**
A: Use the original `UniverseGenerator` with `OrbitalSystem`. This script is for STATIC only.

**Q: Can I manually edit generated platforms?**
A: Yes! They're just GameObjects in your scene. Move them, scale them, add components, etc.
