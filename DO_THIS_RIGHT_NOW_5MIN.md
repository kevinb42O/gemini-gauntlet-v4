2. In Inspector, find **CascadeDebugManager** component
3. Find field: **"Intelligent Profile"**
4. **Drag `AnimationOptimization.asset`** into this field
5. Verify these are checked:
   - ☑️ Enable Intelligent Logging
   - ☑️ Enable Contextual Tracking
   - ☑️ Enable AI Reporting

**✅ Done? Move to Minute 5!**

---

## ⏱️ MINUTE 5: Test It!

1. **Press Play** ▶️
2. Look at Console (bottom of Unity)
3. You should see **GREEN messages**:
   ```
   ✅ IntelligentDebugLogger added
   ✅ ContextualInspectorTracker added
   ✅ AIOptimizationReporter added
   🧠 Tracking 3 scripts
   ```

4. **Play your game for 30 seconds** (move, shoot, animate!)
5. **Stop Play** ⏹️

**✅ Done? Check if it worked!**

---

## 🎉 SUCCESS CHECK

1. Open Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to your project folder (where Assets folder is)
3. Look for new folder: **CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS**
4. Open it
5. You should see:
   ```
   IntelligentLogs/
   ├── LayeredHandAnimationController_[timestamp].txt
   ├── IndividualLayeredHandController_[timestamp].txt
   └── AAAMovementController_[timestamp].txt
   
   OptimizationReports/
   └── AI_Optimization_Report_1_[timestamp].txt
   ```

### If you see these files: **🎊 YOU DID IT! 🎊**

## 🚀 WHAT NOW?

### Option A: Quick Win (15 min)
Open `SMART_QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md` and apply Issue #1

### Option B: Deep Dive (1 hour)
Open `START_HERE_1_HOUR_PLAN.md` and follow the full plan

### Option C: Understand Everything
Open `CASCADE_INTELLIGENT_DEBUG_SYSTEM.md` for complete docs

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING (If Something Went Wrong)

### ❌ "No console messages"
→ Make sure `DebugManager` is in **Hierarchy** (not just Project!)
→ Check that it's enabled (checkbox in Inspector is ☑️)

### ❌ "No SmartDebugProfile assigned" error
→ Drag `AnimationOptimization.asset` into `Intelligent Profile` field again

### ❌ "No files generated"
→ Did you play for 30 seconds?
→ Did you actually move/shoot/do stuff in game?
→ Check console for red errors

### ❌ "Files are empty"
→ Open `AnimationOptimization.asset`
→ Make sure script names are in **Target Script Names** list (exact spelling!)
→ Make sure those scripts exist in your scene
→ Try disabling "Log Only On Change" temporarily
