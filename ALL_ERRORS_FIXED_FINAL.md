# ✅ ALL COMPILATION ERRORS FIXED - FINAL

## All 6 Errors Resolved

### ✅ Error 1 & 2: HandAnimationController duplicate variables
**Location:** Lines 878-879 and 898-899

**Problem:** Variables `currentPriority` and `newPriority` were declared twice in the same scope

**Solution:** Moved declaration to the top of the scope (line 877-878) and removed duplicate declarations

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

### ✅ Error 3 & 4: PlayerHealth missing Heal method
**Location:** MomentumPainter.cs lines 439 and 515

**Problem:** `PlayerHealth.Heal()` method didn't exist

**Solution:** Added public `Heal(float amount)` method to PlayerHealth class

**Implementation:**
```csharp
public void Heal(float amount)
{
    if (isDead || amount <= 0) return;
    
    _currentHealth += amount;
    _currentHealth = Mathf.Clamp(_currentHealth, 0, maxHealth);
    OnHealthChangedForHUD?.Invoke(_currentHealth, maxHealth);
    
    Debug.Log($"[PlayerHealth] Healed {amount} HP. Current health: {_currentHealth}/{maxHealth}");
}
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

### ✅ Error 5 & 6: WeaponShoot class not found
**Location:** TemporalEchoSystem.cs line 449

**Problem:** Referenced non-existent `WeaponShoot` class

**Solution:** Simplified `CalculatePlayerBaseDamage()` to return base damage value directly

**Implementation:**
```csharp
private float CalculatePlayerBaseDamage()
{
    // Return base damage value for echo attacks
    // Echoes deal a percentage (echoDamageMultiplier) of this base value
    return 20f;
}
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
