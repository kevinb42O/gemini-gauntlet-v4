# 🎯 LAND ANIMATION SETUP - Smart Detection System

## ✅ FIXED: Minimum Air Time Check Added!

Landing animation now **only plays** when player has been in air for **≥ 0.5 seconds**!

---

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### **Before Fix:**
```
Player walks over small bump (0.1s airtime) → Land animation plays ❌
Player steps down stair (0.05s airtime) → Land animation plays ❌
Player jumps (0.8s airtime) → Land animation plays ✅

Result: Land animation spam on every tiny bump!
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Player walks over small bump (0.1s airtime) → SKIPPED (< 0.5s) ✅
Player steps down stair (0.05s airtime) → SKIPPED (< 0.5s) ✅
Player jumps (0.8s airtime) → Land animation plays ✅

Result: Land animation only on REAL landings!
```

## 🔧 Unity Animator Setup

### **Transitions Needed:**

#### 1. **Any State → Land**
```
Condition: movementState == 4
Has Exit Time: NO (must interrupt immediately)
Transition Duration: 0.1 seconds (quick blend)
```

**Why Any State?**
- Player can land from **any movement state** (Sprint, Jump, Walk, Slide, Dive, Flight)
- Land needs to **interrupt immediately** when triggered
- Clean, universal transition from all states

#### 2. **Land → Idle**
```
Condition: movementState == 0
Has Exit Time: NO (code controls duration)
Transition Duration: 0.2 seconds (smooth blend to idle)
```

**Why movementState == 0?**
- PlayerAnimationStateManager locks Land for 0.5 seconds
- After 0.5s, auto-detection returns to appropriate state
- If player is standing still, movementState becomes 0 (Idle)
- Transition to Idle happens automatically

## 📊 State Flow Diagram

### **Normal Jump & Land:**
```
1. Player is idle/walking/sprinting
   └─> movementState = 0/1/2

2. Player jumps (Space)
   └─> movementState = 3 (Jump)
       └─> Jump animation plays

3. Player is in air for 0.8 seconds
   └─> Still airborne, Jump animation completes

4. Player lands
   └─> AAAMovementController detects: IsGrounded = true
       └─> Calculates air time: 0.8s
           └─> Check: 0.8s >= 0.5s? YES ✅
               └─> movementState = 4 (Land)
                   └─> Unity Animator: Any State → Land
                       └─> Land animation plays for 0.5s
                           └─> PlayerAnimationStateManager unlocks after 0.5s
                               └─> Auto-detection checks state
                                   └─> Player standing still?
                                       └─> movementState = 0 (Idle)
                                           └─> Unity Animator: Land → Idle
```

### **Sprint Landing (Skip Land Animation):**
```
1. Player sprints
   └─> movementState = 2 (Sprint)

2. Player jumps while sprinting
   └─> movementState = 3 (Jump)

3. Player lands while STILL holding Shift+W
   └─> AAAMovementController detects: IsGrounded = true
       └─> Calculates air time: 0.8s
           └─> Check: Still sprinting? YES
               └─> SKIP Land animation! ⚡
                   └─> Don't set movementState
                       └─> Auto-detection immediately picks up Sprint
                           └─> movementState = 2 (Sprint)
                               └─> Sprint resumes INSTANTLY!
```

### **Small Bump (Skip Land Animation):**
```
1. Player walks
   └─> movementState = 1 (Walk)

2. Player walks over small bump
   └─> Briefly airborne (0.1s)
       └─> AAAMovementController detects: IsGrounded = false
           └─> Tracks timeLeftGround

3. Player lands immediately (tiny bump)
   └─> AAAMovementController detects: IsGrounded = true
       └─> Calculates air time: 0.1s
           └─> Check: 0.1s >= 0.5s? NO ❌
               └─> SKIP Land animation! ⚡
                   └─> Don't set movementState
                       └─> Walk animation continues smoothly
```

## 🔧 Code Changes Applied

### **1. Added Air Time Tracking:**
```csharp
// Track when player leaves ground
private float timeLeftGround = -999f;
private const float MIN_AIR_TIME_FOR_LAND_ANIM = 0.5f; // Configurable threshold
```

### **2. Record Takeoff Time:**
```csharp
// When player becomes airborne
if (wasGrounded && !IsGrounded)
{
    timeLeftGround = Time.time;
}
```

### **3. Smart Landing Detection:**
```csharp
// When player lands
if (IsGrounded && !canJump)
{
    float airTime = Time.time - timeLeftGround;
    bool wasInAirLongEnough = airTime >= MIN_AIR_TIME_FOR_LAND_ANIM;
    bool isSprinting = energySystem.IsCurrentlySprinting;
    
    if (!wasInAirLongEnough)
    {
        // SKIP - Tiny bump (< 0.5s)
        Debug.Log($"⚡ [TINY JUMP] Air time {airTime:F2}s - SKIPPING Land animation");
    }
    else if (isSprinting)
    {
        // SKIP - Sprint landing (instant resume)
        Debug.Log($"⚡ [SPRINT LANDING] SKIPPING Land animation");
    }
    else
    {
        // PLAY - Real landing (≥ 0.5s)
        _animationStateManager.SetMovementState(Land);
        Debug.Log($"🎬 [LANDING ANIMATION] Air time {airTime:F2}s");
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Three Conditions for Land Animation

The Land animation **ONLY plays** when **ALL THREE** are true:

### ✅ Condition 1: Minimum Air Time
```
airTime >= 0.5 seconds
```
Prevents spam on small bumps, stairs, and tiny jumps.

### ✅ Condition 2: Not Sprinting
```
!energySystem.IsCurrentlySprinting
```
If player is still sprinting, skip Land for instant sprint resume.

### ✅ Condition 3: Actually Landed
```
IsGrounded && !canJump
```
Player touched ground after being airborne.

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### **Test 1: Normal Jump** ✅
```
1. Stand still
2. Press Space
3. Wait for landing
4. Expected: Land animation plays → Idle
```

**Console:**
```
🛫 [AIRBORNE] Player left ground
⚡ [GROUNDED] Landing INSTANTLY! Air time: 0.8s
🎬 [LANDING ANIMATION] Air time 0.8s - Playing Land animation
```

### **Test 2: Sprint Landing** ✅
```
1. Sprint (Shift + W)
2. Press Space while sprinting
3. Keep holding Shift + W while landing
4. Expected: NO Land animation, Sprint resumes instantly
```

**Console:**
```
🛫 [AIRBORNE] Player left ground
⚡ [GROUNDED] Landing INSTANTLY! Air time: 0.7s
⚡ [SPRINT LANDING] Air time 0.7s - SKIPPING Land animation, resuming Sprint
```

### **Test 3: Walk Over Bump** ✅
```
1. Walk forward (W)
2. Walk over small bump/step
3. Expected: NO Land animation, Walk continues smoothly
```

**Console:**
```
🛫 [AIRBORNE] Player left ground
⚡ [GROUNDED] Landing INSTANTLY! Air time: 0.1s
⚡ [TINY JUMP] Air time 0.1s < 0.5s - SKIPPING Land animation
```

### **Test 4: Walk and Jump** ✅
```
1. Walk forward (W)
2. Press Space
3. Let go of W before landing
4. Expected: Land animation plays → Idle
```

**Console:**
```
🛫 [AIRBORNE] Player left ground
⚡ [GROUNDED] Landing INSTANTLY! Air time: 0.6s
🎬 [LANDING ANIMATION] Air time 0.6s - Playing Land animation (not sprinting)
```

## 🔧 Tuning the Threshold

If **0.5 seconds** feels wrong, you can adjust it:

### In `AAAMovementController.cs`:
```csharp
private const float MIN_AIR_TIME_FOR_LAND_ANIM = 0.5f; // ← Change this value
```

### Recommended Values:
- **0.3s** = More responsive, plays on shorter jumps
- **0.5s** = Balanced (current setting) ✅
- **0.7s** = Only plays on high/long jumps
- **1.0s** = Only plays on very big falls

Test different values to find what feels best for your game!

## 🚀 Integration with Layered System

### **Base Layer (Movement):**
- Land animation plays on Base Layer
- Full body animation (controlled by blend mask)
- Locks for 0.5 seconds (PlayerAnimationStateManager)

### **Shooting Layer (Additive):**
- **You CAN shoot during landing!** 🎯
- Shooting gestures blend on top
- Layer weight stays at 1.0 if shooting

### **Emote Layer (Override):**
- Emotes blocked during Land (one-shot animation)
- System automatically prevents emotes during landing

### **Ability Layer (Override):**
- Armor plates blocked during Land
- Land is a brief recovery moment

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue:** Land animation plays on every tiny bump
**Solution:** Increase `MIN_AIR_TIME_FOR_LAND_ANIM` to 0.6s or 0.7s

### **Issue:** Land animation never plays
**Solution:** 
- Check `MIN_AIR_TIME_FOR_LAND_ANIM` isn't too high
- Verify Unity Animator has "Any State → Land" transition
- Check Console logs for skip reasons

### **Issue:** Land animation plays when sprinting
**Solution:** This is fixed! Check that EnergySystem is properly attached to Player

### **Issue:** Land → Idle transition doesn't work
**Solution:** 
- Verify "Land → Idle" transition exists with movementState == 0 condition
- Check that transition has No Exit Time (code controls duration)

Changes made:
- ✅ Added minimum air time threshold (0.5s)
- ✅ Track when player becomes airborne
- ✅ Calculate air time on landing
- ✅ Smart skip logic for small bumps
- ✅ Smart skip logic for sprint landings
- ✅ Detailed debug logging
