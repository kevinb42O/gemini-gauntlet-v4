## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Variables:
```csharp
public float doorCloseSpeed = 0.1f;        // Very slow closing
public float doorOpenDuration = 15f;       // Time before closing
public ExitZone exitZone;                  // Reference to exit zone
private bool isClosing = false;            // Closing state
private float doorOpenTimer = 0f;          // Countdown timer
```

### New Methods:
- `UpdateDoorOpenTimer()` - Counts down 15 seconds
- `CloseDoors()` - Slow dramatic door closing coroutine
- `ShowDoorsOpenMessage()` - "Doors will close in 15s!"
- `ShowDoorsClosingMessage()` - "DOORS CLOSING!"
- `ShowExitActiveMessage()` - "Exit zone activated!"
- `PlayDoorCloseSound()` - Door closing audio

### State Flow:
```
Locked → Arriving → Arrived → Opening → Open (15s timer) → Closing → Closed (Exit Active)
```

## 🎮 Setup (Quick Update)

### If you already have the elevator system:

1. **Open ElevatorDoor in Inspector**
2. **Set Door Close Speed:** `0.1` (very slow)
3. **Set Door Open Duration:** `15` (seconds)
4. **Assign Exit Zone:** Drag your ExitZone component
5. **Optional:** Assign door close sound

**That's it!** The system now has dramatic closing!

## 🐛 Important Notes

### ExitZone Behavior:
- **Starts disabled** (player can't exfil immediately)
- **Activates when doors close** (intentional design)
- **Player must be inside elevator** before doors close
- **Then wait for doors to close** to exfil

### Timing:
- **15 seconds open** = enough time to get in
- **10 seconds closing** = dramatic but not too long
- **Total: ~47 seconds** from keycard use to exfil

### Speed:
- **Open speed: 2.0** (normal, quick opening)
- **Close speed: 0.1** (10x slower, dramatic)

✅ **More Tense** - Multiple pressure points  
✅ **More Dramatic** - Slow-closing doors  
✅ **More Strategic** - Timing decisions matter  
✅ **More Cinematic** - Hollywood-style escape  
✅ **More Replayable** - Different each time
