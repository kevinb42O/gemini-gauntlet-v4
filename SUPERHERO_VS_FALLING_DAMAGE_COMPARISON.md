            |
            | Falls 1000 units

## Key Difference: Tracking Method

### FallingDamageSystem:
```
Start Fall: Position A (x:100, y:500, z:200)
           ↓
           | Player moves: forward 300 units
           | Player falls: down 200 units
           ↓
End Fall:  Position B (x:400, y:300, z:200)
           
Fall Distance = √[(400-100)² + (300-500)² + (200-200)²]
              = √[90000 + 40000 + 0]
              = ~360 units total distance

⚠️ Problem: Doesn't feel right for high-mobility!
```

### SuperheroLandingSystem:
```
Start Fall: Y = 500
           ↓
           | Player moves: forward 300 units (IGNORED!)
           | Player falls: down 200 units
           ↓
End Fall:  Y = 300
           
Fall Distance = 500 - 300 = 200 units (Y-axis ONLY)

✅ Perfect: Only vertical matters!
```

## Your Specific Case

### You Said:

> "Only the distance travelled downwards shall be important"
> "Nice AOE effect to appear where I land"

### Perfect Match:
```
✅ SuperheroLandingSystem

Why?
1. NO DAMAGE (superpowers!)
2. World Y-axis tracking (only downward distance)
3. AOE effect at feet (visual feedback)
4. Empowering feel (hero fantasy)
```

## Can You Use Both?

### YES! Example Setup:

```csharp
// Normal gameplay - superhero mode
SuperheroLandingSystem.enabled = true;
FallingDamageSystem.enabled = false;

// Hardcore mode toggle
if (hardcoreMode)
{
    SuperheroLandingSystem.enabled = false;
    FallingDamageSystem.enabled = true;
}

// Specific zone (e.g., "no powers" area)
if (inNoPowerZone)
{
    SuperheroLandingSystem.enabled = false;
    FallingDamageSystem.enabled = true;
}
```

**Both systems are compatible!** They don't interfere with each other.
