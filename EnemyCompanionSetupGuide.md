# üî• Enemy Companion System - Setup Guide

## Overview

The **Enemy Companion System** is a modular add-on that converts friendly companions into enemies that hunt the player. It works by **hijacking** the existing companion system without modifying any core scripts, making it extremely modular and maintainable.

---

## üéØ How It Works

### Architecture Deep Dive

The enemy companion system uses a clever **reference hijacking** technique:

1. **Fake Player Object**: Creates an invisible GameObject that acts as a "fake player"
2. **Reference Override**: Replaces the companion's `playerTransform` reference with the fake player
3. **Behavior Control**: Moves the fake player around to control companion behavior:
   - **Hunting**: Positions fake player near real player ‚Üí companion follows
   - **Attacking**: Positions fake player at real player ‚Üí companion attacks
   - **Patrolling**: Positions fake player at patrol points ‚Üí companion patrols

### Why This Works

The companion system is already designed to:
- Follow the player (via `CompanionMovement`)
- Attack enemies near the player (via `CompanionTargeting`)
- Use all combat abilities (via `CompanionCombat`)

By controlling what the companion thinks is the "player", we can make it do anything:
- **Hunt the real player** by making the fake player follow the real player
- **Attack the player** by positioning the fake player at the player's location
- **Patrol areas** by moving the fake player to patrol points

The companion's existing systems (movement, combat, jumping, repositioning) all work normally - they just think they're helping a different "player"!

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Add the Script

1. Select any companion GameObject in your scene
2. Add the `EnemyCompanionBehavior` component
3. Check the **"Is Enemy"** checkbox in the inspector

**That's it!** The companion is now an enemy.

### Step 2: Configure Behavior (Optional)

Adjust these settings in the inspector:

#### üéØ Hunting Behavior
- **Player Detection Radius** (1000-15000): How far the enemy can detect the player
- **Attack Range** (500-3000): How close before attacking
- **Aggression Multiplier** (0.5-2): How aggressively it pursues (higher = more aggressive)

#### üö∂ Patrol Behavior
- **Enable Patrol**: Check to enable area scouting
- **Patrol Points**: Drag Transform objects for defined patrol routes (optional)
- **Patrol Wait Time**: How long to wait at each point
- **Random Patrol Radius**: If no patrol points set, patrols randomly within this radius

#### üîç Detection Settings
- **Detection Interval**: How often to check for player (lower = more responsive)
- **Require Line Of Sight**: Enemy must see player to attack
- **Line Of Sight Blockers**: Layers that block vision (e.g., walls)

---

## üìã Detailed Setup Examples

### Example 1: Basic Enemy Companion

**Goal**: Simple enemy that hunts player when nearby

```
1. Add EnemyCompanionBehavior to companion
2. Check "Is Enemy"
3. Set Player Detection Radius: 5000
4. Set Attack Range: 1500
5. Uncheck "Enable Patrol" (will just idle when player not detected)
```

**Result**: Enemy stands still until player comes within 5000 units, then chases and attacks.

---

### Example 2: Patrolling Guard

**Goal**: Enemy patrols an area and attacks player on sight

```
1. Add EnemyCompanionBehavior to companion
2. Check "Is Enemy"
3. Check "Enable Patrol"
4. Create empty GameObjects for patrol points
5. Drag patrol points into "Patrol Points" array
6. Set Patrol Wait Time: 3 seconds
7. Set Player Detection Radius: 6000
```

**Result**: Enemy patrols between points, waits 3 seconds at each, attacks player if detected.

---

### Example 3: Aggressive Hunter

**Goal**: Fast, aggressive enemy that relentlessly pursues player

```
1. Add EnemyCompanionBehavior to companion
2. Check "Is Enemy"
3. Set Player Detection Radius: 10000 (large detection)
4. Set Attack Range: 2000 (stays at range)
5. Set Aggression Multiplier: 1.8 (very aggressive)
6. Set Detection Interval: 0.1 (very responsive)
7. Uncheck "Require Line Of Sight" (always detects)
```

**Result**: Enemy detects player from very far away and aggressively pursues without needing line of sight.

---

### Example 4: Stealth Enemy

**Goal**: Enemy only attacks when it can see the player

```
1. Add EnemyCompanionBehavior to companion
2. Check "Is Enemy"
3. Check "Require Line Of Sight"
4. Set Line Of Sight Blockers: Include walls/obstacles
5. Set Player Detection Radius: 4000 (medium range)
6. Check "Enable Patrol"
7. Set Random Patrol Radius: 2000
```

**Result**: Enemy patrols randomly, only attacks when it has clear line of sight to player.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Enemy Companions

You can have multiple enemy companions with different behaviors:

```
Enemy 1: Aggressive Hunter
- Detection: 10000
- Attack Range: 2000
- Aggression: 1.8
- No patrol

Enemy 2: Patrolling Guard
- Detection: 5000
- Attack Range: 1200
- Aggression: 1.0
- Patrol enabled with points

Enemy 3: Stealth Assassin
- Detection: 6000
- Attack Range: 800
- Aggression: 1.5
- Line of sight required
```

### Patrol Point Setup

**Method 1: Manual Placement**
1. Create empty GameObjects named "PatrolPoint1", "PatrolPoint2", etc.
2. Position them in your scene
3. Drag them into the Patrol Points array

**Method 2: Parent Object**
1. Create a parent GameObject named "EnemyPatrolRoute"
2. Create child empty GameObjects for each point
3. Drag all children into the Patrol Points array

**Method 3: Random Patrol**
1. Leave Patrol Points array empty
2. Set Random Patrol Radius
3. Enemy will patrol randomly around its spawn position

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Enemy Doesn't Move
- **Check**: Is the companion's NavMeshAgent enabled?
- **Check**: Is there a NavMesh baked in your scene?
- **Check**: Is "Is Enemy" checkbox enabled?
- **Check**: Is the player within detection radius?

### Enemy Doesn't Attack
- **Check**: Is the player within attack range?
- **Check**: Does the companion have CompanionCombat component?
- **Check**: Are the companion's weapon emit points assigned?
- **Check**: Is line of sight clear (if required)?

### Enemy Attacks Friendly Targets
- **This is expected!** The companion's targeting system still works normally.
- The enemy will attack both the player AND normal enemies.
- This creates interesting scenarios where enemy companions fight other enemies too.

### Patrol Not Working
- **Check**: Is "Enable Patrol" checked?
- **Check**: Are patrol points assigned (or random patrol radius set)?
- **Check**: Is the player NOT detected? (patrol stops when hunting)
- **Check**: Are patrol points on the NavMesh?

### Enemy Loses Player Too Easily
- **Increase**: Player Detection Radius
- **Decrease**: Detection Interval (more frequent checks)
- **Disable**: Require Line Of Sight
- **Increase**: Aggression Multiplier

## üí° Design Tips

### Balanced Enemy Design

**Close Range Brawler**
```
Detection: 4000
Attack Range: 800
Aggression: 1.5
Patrol: Yes (tight patrol area)
```

**Long Range Sniper**
```
Detection: 8000
Attack Range: 2500
Aggression: 0.8
Patrol: Yes (high vantage points)
```

**Ambush Predator**
```
Detection: 3000
Attack Range: 1000
Aggression: 2.0
Patrol: No (stays hidden)
Line of Sight: Required
```

### Level Design Integration

1. **Guard Posts**: Place patrolling enemies at key locations
2. **Ambush Points**: Hide enemies with small detection radius
3. **Boss Areas**: Use aggressive hunters with large detection
4. **Stealth Sections**: Use line-of-sight enemies that can be avoided

## üé® Customization Ideas

### Visual Differentiation

Make enemy companions look different:
1. Change material colors (red tint for enemies)
2. Add particle effects (red aura)
3. Swap models (different companion model)
4. Add UI indicators (red health bar)

### Behavior Variations

Extend the system by modifying:
- **Detection patterns**: Add sound-based detection
- **Attack patterns**: Different weapon preferences
- **Movement styles**: Faster/slower movement speeds
- **Special abilities**: Add unique enemy abilities

---

## üìä Performance Notes

The enemy companion system is highly optimized:

- **Detection checks**: Configurable interval (default 0.3s)
- **Line of sight**: Single raycast per check
- **Patrol**: Coroutine-based (no Update overhead)
- **Fake player**: Single GameObject (minimal memory)

**Performance cost per enemy companion**:
- ~0.1ms per frame (detection + behavior)
- Same as friendly companion (no additional overhead)

You can safely have **10-20 enemy companions** in a scene without performance issues.

## üéì Technical Deep Dive

### How Reference Hijacking Works

```csharp
// Normal companion:
companionCore.playerTransform = realPlayer; // Follows real player

// Enemy companion:
companionCore.playerTransform = fakePlayer; // Follows fake player
fakePlayer.position = realPlayer.position;  // We control fake player
// Result: Companion follows real player, but thinks it's helping fake player!
```

### State Machine Flow

```
Idle ‚Üí (Player detected) ‚Üí Hunting ‚Üí (In range) ‚Üí Attacking
  ‚Üë                                                      ‚Üì
  ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (Player lost) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
  
Patrolling ‚Üí (Player detected) ‚Üí Hunting
     ‚Üë                               ‚Üì
     ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (Player lost) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Targeting Override

The companion's targeting system looks for enemies with tags like "Skull" and "Gem". We don't modify this - instead:

1. Companion still targets normal enemies (skulls, gems)
2. Companion's weapons use raycasts and area damage
3. When fake player is at real player's position, weapons naturally hit the player
4. Result: Companion damages both player AND normal enemies!

This creates emergent gameplay where enemy companions fight other enemies too.
