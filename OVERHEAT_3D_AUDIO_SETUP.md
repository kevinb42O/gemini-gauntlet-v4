# 🔊 Overheat 3D Audio Setup

## What Changed
Overheat sounds now play from the actual hand position in 3D space, giving you proper directional audio feedback!

---

## 🎯 How to Set Up

### Step 1: Assign AudioSources to PlayerOverheatManager

1. **Select PlayerOverheatManager** GameObject in Hierarchy
2. **Find the new section** in Inspector:
   ```
   ► 3D Audio Sources
      Primary Hand Audio Source    [None]
      Secondary Hand Audio Source  [None]
   ```

### Step 2: Drag Your Hand AudioSources

**For LEFT hand (Primary):**
- Find your LEFT hand GameObject (the one with the AudioSource you added)
- Drag it into **"Primary Hand Audio Source"** field

**For RIGHT hand (Secondary):**
- Find your RIGHT hand GameObject (the one with the AudioSource you added)
- Drag it into **"Secondary Hand Audio Source"** field

### Step 3: Configure AudioSource Settings (Important!)

For **both** hand AudioSources, make sure these settings are correct:

```
AudioSource Component Settings:
├─ Spatial Blend: 1.0 (fully 3D) ✅
├─ Volume Rolloff: Logarithmic
├─ Min Distance: 1-3 (adjust to taste)
├─ Max Distance: 20-50 (adjust to taste)
├─ Play On Awake: OFF ❌
└─ Loop: OFF ❌
```

**Critical:** `Spatial Blend` must be **1.0** for full 3D audio!

## 🎮 How It Works

### Before (2D Audio):
```
Sound plays → Same volume in both ears → No positional info
```

### After (3D Audio):
```
LEFT hand overheats  → Sound from left side 🔊⬅️
RIGHT hand overheats → Sound from right side ➡️🔊
Move head/camera     → Sound pans correctly
Distance matters     → Farther = quieter
```

## 🔊 Sound Behavior

| Event | Plays From | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 50% heat warning | Specific hand | Directional beep |
| 70% critical warning | Specific hand | Directional alarm |
| 100% overheat | Specific hand | Directional critical sound |
| Blocked shot | Specific hand | Directional error buzz |

**Each hand has independent 3D audio!**

---

## ✅ Testing

1. **Enter Play Mode**
2. **Fire LEFT hand (LMB)** until 50% heat
   - Sound should come from **left side** 🔊⬅️
3. **Fire RIGHT hand (RMB)** until 50% heat
   - Sound should come from **right side** ➡️🔊
4. **Move your camera/head**
   - Sounds should pan correctly with movement
5. **Overheat one hand**
   - Critical sound comes from that specific hand

## 🎛️ Audio Tuning Tips

### If sounds are too quiet:
- Increase `Volume` on AudioSource
- Increase `Max Distance`
- Decrease `Min Distance`

### If sounds don't feel 3D enough:
- Check `Spatial Blend` = **1.0** (not 0!)
- Adjust `Volume Rolloff` curve
- Try different `Min Distance` values

### If sounds are too loud up close:
- Decrease `Volume` on AudioSource
- Increase `Min Distance`
- Adjust `Volume Rolloff` to `Linear` for gentler falloff

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No AudioSource assigned" warning in Console
**Fix:** Drag your hand GameObjects into the AudioSource fields in PlayerOverheatManager

### Sounds still play in 2D (no directional audio)
**Fix:** Check AudioSource `Spatial Blend` = 1.0 on both hands

### Sounds too quiet
**Fix:** Increase AudioSource `Volume` or `Max Distance`

### Sounds play from wrong hand
**Fix:** Make sure you dragged:
- LEFT hand → Primary Hand Audio Source
- RIGHT hand → Secondary Hand Audio Source

## 📋 Quick Checklist

```
☐ Added AudioSource to LEFT hand GameObject
☐ Added AudioSource to RIGHT hand GameObject
☐ Set Spatial Blend = 1.0 on both AudioSources
☐ Set Play On Awake = OFF on both AudioSources
☐ Dragged LEFT hand to Primary Hand Audio Source field
☐ Dragged RIGHT hand to Secondary Hand Audio Source field
☐ Tested in Play Mode - sounds come from correct sides
```

## 🎯 Result

✅ **Directional audio** - sounds come from the correct hand  
✅ **Immersive feedback** - you can "feel" which hand is overheating  
✅ **Professional polish** - AAA-quality spatial audio  
✅ **Independent hands** - each hand has its own audio position  

**Your overheat system now has full 3D positional audio!** 🔊🎮

*Sounds now come from where they should - the actual hands!* 🔥
