# 🎬 Time Dilation - Hold to Activate System

## ✅ **WHAT WAS CHANGED**

Modified the time dilation system so slow-mo is **ONLY active while holding the scroll wheel button** (until you land).

---

## 🎮 **HOW IT WORKS NOW**

### **Activation:**
1. **Press & Hold** scroll wheel button (middle mouse)
2. **Jump** is triggered (if grounded)
3. **Freestyle mode** activates
4. **Slow-mo ramps in** smoothly (0.5s)
5. Time slows to 0.5x speed → **Extended air time!**

### **While Holding:**
- ✅ Slow-mo stays active
- ✅ Gravity is 50% speed (you fall slower)
- ✅ Movement is 50% speed (everything in slow-mo)
- ✅ Camera tricks work normally
- ✅ Air time is doubled

### **When You Release:**
- 🎬 **Slow-mo ramps out** smoothly (0.5s)
- ⚡ Time returns to normal speed
- 🎮 Jump cut applied (if still rising)
- 🎪 Freestyle camera stays active until landing

### **When You Land:**
- 🎬 Slow-mo fully deactivates
- 📷 Camera reconciles to normal orientation
- 🔄 Button hold state resets
- ✅ Ready for next trick

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL CHANGES**

### **1. Slow-Mo Activation Condition:**
**OLD:**
```csharp
bool shouldBeDilated = isFreestyleModeActive;
```

**NEW:**
```csharp
bool isAirborne = movementController != null && !movementController.IsGrounded;
bool shouldBeDilated = isFreestyleModeActive && isHoldingScrollWheelButton && isAirborne;
```

### **2. Button Release Handling:**
Added slow-mo ramp out notification when button is released:
```csharp
// 🎬 SLOW-MO: Releasing button starts ramping out of slow-mo
Debug.Log("🎬 [TIME DILATION] Scroll button released - Ramping out of slow-mo");
```

### **3. Landing State Reset:**
Added button hold state reset on landing:
```csharp
// Reset button hold state on landing
isHoldingScrollWheelButton = false;
```

## 🎯 **BEHAVIOR SUMMARY**

| Action | Slow-Mo State | Time Scale | Air Time |
|--------|---------------|------------|----------|
| **Grounded** | ❌ Inactive | 1.0x | Normal |
| **Jump + Hold Button** | ✅ Ramping IN | 1.0x → 0.5x | Extending |
| **Airborne + Holding** | ✅ Active | 0.5x | 2x longer |
| **Release Button** | ⚠️ Ramping OUT | 0.5x → 1.0x | Returning |
| **Released (airborne)** | ❌ Inactive | 1.0x | Normal |
| **Landing** | ❌ Inactive | 1.0x | N/A |

## 🎨 **FINE-TUNING OPTIONS**

### **Adjust Slow-Mo Intensity:**
In AAACameraController Inspector:
- **Trick Time Scale**: 0.5 = half speed (default)
  - Lower = more dramatic (0.3 = super slow)
  - Higher = less dramatic (0.7 = slight slow)

### **Adjust Transition Smoothness:**
- **Time Dilation Ramp In**: 0.5s (how long to ramp into slow-mo)
  - Lower = instant slow-mo
  - Higher = gradual slow-mo
- **Time Dilation Ramp Out**: 0.5s (how long to ramp out)
  - Lower = instant return to normal
  - Higher = gradual return

### **Adjust Landing Anticipation:**
- **Landing Anticipation Distance**: 150 units
  - When this close to ground, starts ramping out early
  - Lower = ramp out closer to ground
  - Higher = ramp out further from ground

## 🎮 **PLAYER EXPERIENCE**

**Before:**
- Slow-mo was always on during tricks
- No control over when it happens
- Fixed duration

**After:**
- ✅ **Full control** - Hold button = slow-mo, release = normal
- ✅ **Skill expression** - Choose when to use slow-mo
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** - Buttery ramp in/out
- ✅ **Extended air time** - Gravity slows down while holding
- ✅ **Responsive** - Release anytime to return to normal

---

## 🚀 **RESULT**

**You now have Matrix-style bullet time control!**
- Hold scroll wheel = slow-mo + extended air time
- Release = instant return to normal speed
- Land = everything resets

**Perfect for:**
- 🎯 Lining up precise trick sequences
- 🎬 Cinematic moments you control
- ⚡ Quick reactions when needed
- 🎪 Showing off complex aerial maneuvers
