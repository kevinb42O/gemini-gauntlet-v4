## 💡 TIPS

### For First Time Players
1. Start at Zone 1 (green) - it's at world origin
2. Sprint before wall jumping for maximum distance
3. Zone 2 teaches the "drop for speed" mechanic
4. Follow the colors: Green → Cyan → Yellow → Orange → Purple → Red

### For Testing
1. Add **ArenaZoneTeleporter** to your player
2. Use number keys to jump between zones
3. Add **PhysicsStatsDisplay** to verify calculations
4. Check speed values match predictions

### For Speedrunning
1. Chain all zones without stopping
2. Optimize routes in each zone
3. Use momentum preservation (35%) between jumps
4. Sub-5-minute full clear is achievable

---

## 🔧 OPTIONAL SETUP

### Add Teleporter to Player (Testing)
1. Select your player in hierarchy
2. Add Component → **ArenaZoneTeleporter**
3. Press 1-6 to teleport between zones
4. Press 0 to return to start

### Add Stats Display to Player (Verification)
1. Select your player in hierarchy
2. Add Component → **PhysicsStatsDisplay**
3. See real-time speed and height data
4. Verify physics calculations work

### Add Progress Tracker to Scene (Completion)
1. Create empty GameObject in scene
2. Add Component → **ArenaProgressTracker**
3. Add trigger colliders to goal platforms
4. Add **ZoneGoalTrigger** component to triggers
5. Set zone index (0-5) on each trigger

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Arena Doesn't Build
- Make sure Unity is fully loaded
- Check Console for errors
- Try: Tools > Physics Perfect Arena > Arena Builder Window
- Build zones individually from window

### Can't Complete Jumps
- Verify you're sprinting (1485 u/s)
- Check sprint is enabled in your movement script
- Add PhysicsStatsDisplay to verify speed
- Make sure momentum preservation is active (35%)

### Falling Through Floors
- Check all platforms have colliders
- Verify CharacterController settings
- Make sure Ground layer is set correctly

### No Spawn Points Visible
- Spawn points are green spheres (200 unit radius)
- They're at Y:150 height at each zone start
- Use Scene view to locate them
