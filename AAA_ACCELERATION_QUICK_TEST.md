# ⚡ ACCELERATION MOVEMENT - QUICK TEST GUIDE

## 🎮 **INSTANT TEST (30 SECONDS)**

### **Basic Movement Feel:**
1. **Walk Forward (W)** → Should accelerate smoothly (not instant)
2. **Release W** → Should decelerate smoothly to stop
3. **Sprint (Shift+W)** → Faster acceleration, higher footstep rate
4. **Stop Sprinting** → Quick deceleration back to walk speed

### **Footstep Sync:**
1. **Stand Still** → No footsteps ✓
2. **Start Walking** → Footsteps slow at first, speed up ✓
3. **Full Sprint** → Rapid footsteps with higher pitch ✓
4. **Stop** → Footsteps stop immediately ✓

### **Slope Physics:**
1. **Walk Downhill** → Should speed up gradually ✓
2. **Walk Uphill** → Should feel harder to climb ✓
3. **Jump Off Ramp** → Should get speed boost ✓

## 🔧 **IF SOMETHING FEELS WRONG**

### **Movement Too Sluggish:**
```csharp
// In AAAMovementController.cs (line ~147)
groundAcceleration = 2400f; // Increase from 1800f
```

### **Movement Too Slippery:**
```csharp
// In AAAMovementController.cs (line ~149)
groundFriction = 1800f; // Increase from 1200f
```

### **Footsteps Too Fast/Slow:**
```csharp
// In PlayerFootstepController.cs (line ~13)
baseStepDelay = 0.6f;  // Increase for slower
minStepDelay = 0.3f;   // Increase for slower sprint
```

### **Disable New System (Test Old):**
```csharp
// In AAAMovementController.cs (line ~153)
enableAccelerationSystem = false; // Use old instant velocity
```

## 📊 **EXPECTED VALUES (At Sprint Speed)**

| Metric | Value | Feel |
|--------|-------|------|
| Acceleration Time | ~0.4s | Responsive but not instant |
| Deceleration Time | ~0.5s | Natural stop |
| Footstep Delay | 0.25s | Rapid (4 per second) |
| Footstep Pitch | 1.15x | Slightly higher |
| Ramp Jump Bonus | +25% | Noticeable boost |

## 🎯 **COMPARISON TEST**

### **OLD SYSTEM (Instant):**
- Press W → BAM! Full speed instantly
- Release W → BAM! Stop instantly
- Footsteps → Fixed rate (sprint or walk)

### **NEW SYSTEM (Acceleration):**
- Press W → Smooth ramp-up (0.3s)
- Release W → Smooth glide to stop (0.5s)
- Footsteps → Dynamic rate matches speed

**Try toggling `enableAccelerationSystem` to feel the difference!**

## ✅ **CHECKLIST FOR APPROVAL**

- [ ] Movement feels smooth (not jerky)
- [ ] Stops feel natural (not instant)
- [ ] Sprint feels faster than walk
- [ ] Footsteps sync with movement
- [ ] Slopes affect speed
- [ ] Ramp jumps give boost
- [ ] Works at 30, 60, 144 FPS

## 🚨 **KNOWN "FEATURES" (Not Bugs)**

1. **Can't instant-stop anymore** → This is intentional (friction system)
2. **Downhill speeds you up** → This is intentional (slope physics)
3. **Footsteps change pitch** → This is intentional (dynamic audio)

If you WANT instant stops like before:
```csharp
groundFriction = 5000f; // Super sticky
stopSpeed = 300f;       // All speeds get high friction
```

## 💡 **PRO TIP: TUNING FOR YOUR GAME**

### **Arcade Feel (Fast & Snappy):**
```csharp
groundAcceleration = 2400f;
groundFriction = 1800f;
stopSpeed = 200f;
```

### **Realistic Feel (Smooth & Momentum):**
```csharp
groundAcceleration = 1500f;
groundFriction = 800f;
stopSpeed = 100f;
```

### **Current (Balanced AAA):**
```csharp
groundAcceleration = 1800f;  // ← DEFAULT
groundFriction = 1200f;      // ← DEFAULT
stopSpeed = 150f;            // ← DEFAULT
```
