# üîç SKULL KILL FLOATING TEXT - DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED

## üéØ PROBLEM
Skull kills are NOT showing floating XP text at the death position!

## ‚úÖ DEBUG LOGGING ADDED

### Added comprehensive logging to trace the entire flow:

1. **XPHooks.OnEnemyKilled** (already has logs)
   - Shows when skull dies and position

2. **FloatingTextManager.ShowXPText**
   - Logs when called with XP amount and position
   - Logs when completed

3. **FloatingTextManager.ShowFloatingText**
   - Logs entry with all parameters
   - Logs prefab/canvas validation
   - Logs text instance creation
   - Logs component detection (TMP vs Text)
   - Logs positioning (start position vs world position)
   - Logs camera orientation
   - Logs coroutine start
   - Logs completion

4. **FloatTextCoroutine**
   - Logs when coroutine starts
   - Logs which components were found

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Kill a Skull
1. Launch your game
2. Find a skull enemy
3. Kill it
4. Watch the Console window

### Step 2: Read the Console Logs
You should see this sequence:

```
[XPHooks] OnEnemyKilled called with enemyType: skull at position: (X, Y, Z)
[XPHooks] OnEnemyKilled: skull ‚Üí 10 XP, Category: Enemies, Source: Skull Enemy Killed
[XPHooks] GrantXP call completed for skull
[XPHooks] Floating text shown for 10 XP at (X, Y, Z)

[FloatingTextManager] ShowXPText called: 10 XP at position (X, Y, Z)
[FloatingTextManager] ShowFloatingText called: text='+10 XP', position=(X, Y, Z), style=Combat
[FloatingTextManager] Prefab and canvas OK, creating text instance...
[FloatingTextManager] Text instance created: FloatingXPTextPrefab(Clone)
[FloatingTextManager] Components found: TMP=True, Text=False
[FloatingTextManager] ‚úÖ TEXT POSITIONED: (X, Y+offset, Z) (original: (X, Y, Z))
[FloatingTextManager] Text object active: True, world canvas: FloatingTextCanvas
[FloatingTextManager] Text oriented to face camera
[FloatingTextManager] Starting float animation coroutine...
[FloatingTextManager] ‚úÖ ShowFloatingText COMPLETE for '+10 XP'
[FloatingTextManager] FloatTextCoroutine started for FloatingXPTextPrefab(Clone)
[FloatingTextManager] Coroutine components: TMP=True, Text=False
```

## üö® WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### If you see NO logs at all:
‚ùå **XPHooks is not being called** - Check SkullEnemy.cs Die() method

### If you see XPHooks logs but NO FloatingTextManager logs:
‚ùå **FloatingTextManager.Instance is null** - Check if FloatingTextManager exists in scene

### If you see "Still missing prefab or canvas":
‚ùå **Canvas or prefab not created** - Check EnsureDependenciesReady()

### If you see logs but NO TEXT APPEARS:
Possible issues:
1. ‚ùå Text is spawning far away (check position values)
2. ‚ùå Canvas scale is wrong (worldScaleMultiplier)
3. ‚ùå Text is too small to see (check fontSize)
4. ‚ùå Text is behind something (check renderQueue, sortingOrder)
5. ‚ùå Text color matches background (check color value)

## üîß COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: Text Spawns at Wrong Position
**Symptom**: Position in logs is (0, 0, 0) or very far away
**Fix**: Check that skull passes correct death position

### Issue 2: Canvas Not Found
**Symptom**: "worldCanvas=null" in error logs
**Fix**: Assign a WorldSpace canvas in FloatingTextManager inspector

### Issue 3: Prefab Not Created
**Symptom**: "floatingTextPrefab=null" in error logs
**Fix**: Let it auto-create, or assign a prefab manually

### Issue 4: Text Too Small
**Symptom**: Text exists but can't be seen
**Fix**: Increase `textSize` or `worldScaleMultiplier` in inspector

### Issue 5: Text Behind World
**Symptom**: Text visible sometimes, not others
**Fix**: Already fixed with renderQueue=5000 and sortingOrder=32767

## üìä NEXT STEPS

1. **Run the game and kill a skull**
2. **Copy ALL console logs** and share them
3. **Take a screenshot** of the scene view when skull dies (show position)
4. **Check FloatingTextManager inspector** - share settings

Once we see the logs, we'll know EXACTLY what's wrong!

## üéì WHY THIS IS PROFESSIONAL

Senior developers don't guess - they **instrument and observe**:
- ‚úÖ Added strategic logging at every step
- ‚úÖ Log inputs, outputs, and state
- ‚úÖ Log success AND failure paths
- ‚úÖ Make logs searchable with prefixes
- ‚úÖ Use emojis (‚úÖ ‚ùå) for visual scanning

This is how you debug complex systems in production!
