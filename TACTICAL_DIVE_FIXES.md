# üéØ TACTICAL DIVE - CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Dive Not Launching Properly
**Problem**: Using `SetExternalGroundVelocity` which is for ground movement, not air launches
**Solution**: Changed to `SetVelocityImmediate()` to directly set velocity and launch into air

### 2. ‚ùå Movement Continuing During Dive
**Problem**: Sprint/forward keys were overriding dive velocity
**Solution**: Dive now has ABSOLUTE PRIORITY - early return blocks all other input processing

### 3. ‚ùå Not Coming to Complete Halt
**Problem**: Landing didn't stop all movement
**Solution**: On landing, `SetVelocityImmediate(Vector3.zero)` forces complete stop

### 4. ‚ùå Horizontal Velocity Decaying
**Problem**: Forward momentum was being lost during flight
**Solution**: Explicitly maintain horizontal dive velocity each frame during flight

### 5. ‚ùå No Dive Animation
**Problem**: Using slide animation instead of proper dive pose
**Solution**: Added full dive animation system to HandAnimationController

## What Was Changed

### CleanAAACrouch.cs
```csharp
// BEFORE: Wrong velocity system
movement.SetExternalGroundVelocity(diveVelocity);

// AFTER: Direct velocity control
movement.SetVelocityImmediate(diveVelocity);
```

```csharp
// BEFORE: Velocity could decay
// (no horizontal maintenance)

// AFTER: Maintain horizontal velocity
Vector3 horizontalDive = new Vector3(diveVelocity.x, 0f, diveVelocity.z);
currentVel.x = horizontalDive.x;
currentVel.z = horizontalDive.z;
```

```csharp
// BEFORE: Didn't stop on landing
movement.ClearExternalGroundVelocity();

// AFTER: Complete halt
movement.SetVelocityImmediate(Vector3.zero);
```

### HandAnimationController.cs
**Added**:
- `leftDiveClip` and `rightDiveClip` animation clip fields
- `HandAnimationState.Dive` enum value
- `DIVE` animator hash
- `PlayDiveAnimation()` public method
- `PlayDiveLeft()`, `PlayDiveRight()`, `PlayDiveBoth()` methods
- Dive case in animation clip getter

## How to Set Up Dive Animations

### In Unity Inspector:

1. **Select Player GameObject**
2. **Find HandAnimationController component**
3. **Scroll to "Animation Clips - Assign in Inspector"**
4. **Assign dive animations**:
   - `Left Dive Clip`: Animation with left hand stretched forward
   - `Right Dive Clip`: Animation with right hand stretched forward

### Recommended Animation:
- **Arms**: Stretched forward (Superman pose)
- **Hands**: Pointing forward, fingers together
- **Duration**: 0.5-1.0 seconds
- **Loop**: No (one-shot animation)

### If You Don't Have Dive Animations Yet:
You can temporarily use the slide animations:
- Assign `leftSlideClip` to `leftDiveClip`
- Assign `rightSlideClip` to `rightDiveClip`
- Create proper dive animations later

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sprint forward (hold Shift + W)
- [ ] Press X while sprinting
- [ ] Player launches forward and up
- [ ] Player flies in arc trajectory
- [ ] Player lands face-first
- [ ] All movement stops on landing
- [ ] Player stays prone for 0.8 seconds
- [ ] Press any key to stand up
- [ ] Dive works even if holding forward/sprint during entire sequence

## Expected Behavior

### Launch Phase:
- Instant velocity change to 720 forward + 240 up
- Camera stays at crouch height
- Dive animation plays on both hands
- Dive sound plays

### Flight Phase:
- Maintains 720 units/s forward speed
- Gravity pulls down at -750 units/s¬≤
- No input can affect trajectory
- Dive animation continues

### Landing Phase:
- Detects ground contact
- **INSTANT STOP** - velocity set to zero
- Heavy camera shake
- Landing sound plays
- Slide particles start

### Prone Phase:
- Player frozen in place
- Crouch height maintained
- Lasts 0.8 seconds
- Any input = instant stand up

## Debug Logs to Watch

```
[TACTICAL DIVE] Initiated! Velocity: (720, 240, 0), Forward: 720, Up: 240
[TACTICAL DIVE] Landed in prone position! COMPLETE HALT.
[TACTICAL DIVE] Standing up from prone!
```

## Common Issues

### "Dive doesn't launch me"
- Check that `diveForwardForce` = 720
- Check that `diveUpwardForce` = 240
- Verify you're sprinting fast enough (320+ units/s)

### "I keep moving after landing"
- This should be fixed now with `SetVelocityImmediate(Vector3.zero)`
- If still happening, check console for errors

### "Dive animation not playing"
- Assign animation clips in Inspector
- Check HandAnimationController is on player
- Temporarily use slide clips if needed

### "Can't stand up from prone"
- Press W, A, S, D, Space, or Ctrl
- Wait 0.8 seconds for auto-stand
- Check console for errors

## Performance Notes

- Dive uses direct velocity manipulation (very efficient)
- No physics forces or rigidbody needed
- Animation system uses state machine (optimized)
- Early return prevents unnecessary calculations

**Status**: ‚úÖ All Critical Issues Fixed
**Ready for Testing**: Yes
**Animation Setup Required**: Yes (assign clips in Inspector)
