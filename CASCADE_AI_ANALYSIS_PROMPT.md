3. Any new issues introduced?
4. What should I optimize next?
```

## üí° PRO TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE PROMPTS

### ‚úÖ DO THIS:

1. **Be Specific About Your Goal**
   - ‚ùå "Make it faster"
   - ‚úÖ "Reduce animation state changes from 20/sec to <5/sec"

2. **Attach Relevant Files Only**
   - ‚ùå Attach all 50 files
   - ‚úÖ Attach AI report + 2-3 relevant script logs

3. **Mention What You've Tried**
   - "I already tried adding a cooldown but it didn't help"
   - This saves time on suggestions you've already tested

4. **Specify Your Constraints**
   - "Must maintain 60 FPS on mid-range PC"
   - "Cannot change the animation system architecture"

5. **Ask for Verification Steps**
   - "How do I know this fix worked?"
   - "What values should I see in the next report?"

### ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS:

1. **Vague Requests**
   - "Something is wrong, fix it"
   - AI needs to know WHAT you're trying to optimize

2. **Attach Everything**
   - Attaching 20 files wastes context
   - Start with AI report, then add specific logs as needed

3. **No Context**
   - "Why is this value changing?"
   - AI needs to know if it's a problem or expected behavior

4. **Ask for Generic Advice**
   - "How do I optimize Unity?"
   - Use the specific data from YOUR game!

**What I Need:**
1. Review the AI report and confirm priorities
2. Tell me which 3 script logs I should attach next for deeper analysis
3. Give me a roadmap: what to fix in what order
4. Estimate total optimization time

**Goal:** Smooth 60 FPS gameplay on mid-range PC
```
