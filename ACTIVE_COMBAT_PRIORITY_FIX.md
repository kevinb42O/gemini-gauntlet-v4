# 🎯 CRITICAL FIX - Active Combat Input > Sprint

**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Status:** ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**

---

## 🚨 The Critical Issue

### **The Problem:**
```
Player sprinting (both hands in sprint animation)
↓
Player presses LEFT shotgun
↓
Sprint (P7) > Shotgun (P2) ❌
↓
LEFT hand stays in sprint animation
Shotgun doesn't fire visually!
```

**This is WRONG!** ❌

### **What Should Happen:**
```
Player sprinting (both hands in sprint animation)
↓
Player presses LEFT shotgun
↓
Shotgun (P8) > Sprint (P7) ✅
↓
LEFT hand plays shotgun animation
RIGHT hand continues sprint animation
Shotgun VFX fires!
```

**This is CORRECT!** ✅

---

## 🎯 The Solution

### **Key Principle:**

**Active Combat Input > Sprint > Passive Movement**

- When player **actively presses fire** → That hand fires (even while sprinting)
- When player **not pressing fire** → Sprint is king
- Each hand is **independent** → Left can fire, right can sprint

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### **NEW Priority Hierarchy:**

```
Priority 10: EMOTE (Hard Locked) ← Highest
Priority 9:  ABILITY (ArmorPlate - Hard Locked)
Priority 8:  SHOTGUN/BEAM ← ACTIVE COMBAT! (overrides sprint)
Priority 7:  SPRINT ← Highest passive movement
Priority 6:  JUMP/LAND/TAKEOFF
Priority 5:  WALK
Priority 4:  TACTICAL (Dive/Slide - Soft Locked)
Priority 3:  FLIGHT
Priority 0:  IDLE
```

### **Key Change:**
- **Shotgun/Beam moved from P2 → P8**
- **Now ABOVE sprint (P7)**
- **Active input always wins!**

## 🎮 Real-World Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Shoot Left Hand While Sprinting**
```
Initial State:
├─ LEFT hand: Sprint animation
└─ RIGHT hand: Sprint animation

Player Input: Press LEFT shotgun (LMB)
↓
LEFT hand transition:
├─ Shotgun (P8) > Sprint (P7) ✅
├─ LEFT hand plays shotgun animation (INSTANT blend)
├─ Shotgun VFX fires from LEFT hand
└─ Player sees LEFT hand shoot! 🔥

RIGHT hand continues:
└─ RIGHT hand stays in sprint animation ✅

Result: LEFT shoots, RIGHT sprints = PERFECT! 💪
```

### **Scenario 2: Shoot Both Hands While Sprinting**
```
Initial State:
├─ LEFT hand: Sprint animation
└─ RIGHT hand: Sprint animation

Player Input: Press BOTH shotguns (LMB + RMB)
↓
BOTH hands transition:
├─ Shotgun (P8) > Sprint (P7) ✅
├─ LEFT hand plays shotgun animation
├─ RIGHT hand plays shotgun animation
├─ Both VFX fire
└─ Player sees dual shotgun blast! 🔥🔥

Result: Dual fire while sprinting = AWESOME! 💥
```

### **Scenario 3: Beam While Sprinting**
```
Initial State:
├─ LEFT hand: Sprint animation
└─ RIGHT hand: Sprint animation

Player Input: Hold LEFT beam (RMB)
↓
LEFT hand transition:
├─ Beam (P8) > Sprint (P7) ✅
├─ LEFT hand plays beam animation (FAST blend 0.1s)
├─ Beam VFX starts from LEFT hand
└─ Player sees LEFT hand emit beam! ⚡

RIGHT hand continues:
└─ RIGHT hand stays in sprint animation ✅

Result: LEFT beams, RIGHT sprints, player moves fast! 🚀
```

### **Scenario 4: Sprint Resumes After Shooting**
```
State: Player finishes left shotgun
├─ LEFT hand: Shotgun animation complete
└─ RIGHT hand: Sprint animation

Movement System: Player still holding Shift
↓
LEFT hand transition:
├─ Sprint requested (P7)
├─ No higher priority input active
├─ LEFT hand transitions to sprint (SMOOTH blend 0.3s)
└─ LEFT hand resumes sprint animation ✅

Result: BOTH hands back to sprinting naturally! 🏃
```

## 📊 Priority Comparison

### **BEFORE (Broken):**
```
Sprint (P7) > Shotgun (P2)
↓
Press fire while sprinting → Blocked ❌
Can't shoot while sprinting ❌
Player frustrated ❌
```

### **AFTER (Fixed):**
```
Shotgun (P8) > Sprint (P7)
↓
Press fire while sprinting → Fires! ✅
Can shoot while sprinting ✅
Player happy! ✅
```
