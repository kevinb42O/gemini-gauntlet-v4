# 🎨 PARTICLE PAINTING SYSTEM - Setup Guide
**Paint the scene with persistent particles that stick to surfaces!**

---

## 🎯 What This Does

Your particles will now:
- ✅ Stick to surfaces when they collide
- ✅ Stay visible for 5 seconds after collision
- ✅ Work with both shotgun AND stream VFX
- ✅ Use object pooling (no performance hit!)
- ✅ Auto-cleanup old decals to prevent buildup

---

## 🔧 COMPLETE SETUP (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Create ParticleDecalManager GameObject

1. **In Unity Hierarchy:**
   - Right-click → Create Empty
   - Name: `ParticleDecalManager`

2. **Add Component:**
   - Add Component → `ParticleDecalManager`

3. **Configure in Inspector:**
   ```
   ParticleDecalManager:
   ├─ Decal Particle Prefab: [Will create in Step 2]
   ├─ Decal Lifetime: 5.0
   ├─ Max Active Decals: 500
   ├─ Pool Size: 100
   └─ Enable Debug Logs: ☐ (turn on for testing)
   ```

---

### Step 2: Create Decal Particle Prefab

This is a simple particle system that represents a single "stuck" particle.

#### In Unity:
1. **Create new GameObject:**
   - Right-click in Hierarchy → Effects → Particle System
   - Name: `ParticleDecal`

2. **Configure Particle System:**

**Main Module:**
```
Duration: 5.00
Looping: OFF
Start Lifetime: 5.00
Start Speed: 0
Start Size: 0.2 (adjust to match your VFX particle size)
Start Color: White (will be set dynamically)
Gravity Modifier: 0
Simulation Space: World
Max Particles: 1
```

**Emission Module:**
```
Rate over Time: 0
Bursts: None (particles spawned via script)
```

**Shape Module:**
```
Disabled (not needed)
```

**Renderer Module:**
```
Render Mode: Billboard
Material: [Use same material as your shotgun/beam particles]
```

3. **Save as Prefab:**
   - Drag `ParticleDecal` from Hierarchy to Project folder
   - Delete from Hierarchy
   - **Assign this prefab** to ParticleDecalManager's "Decal Particle Prefab" field

---

### Step 3: Add Scripts to Your VFX Prefabs

For **EACH** of your 16 VFX prefabs (8 shotgun + 8 beam):

1. **Open VFX prefab**
2. **Find the main ParticleSystem** (the one that shoots particles)
3. **Add Component:** `ParticleCollisionHandler`
4. **Configure:**
   ```
   ParticleCollisionHandler:
   ├─ Create Decals On Collision: ✓
   ├─ Decal Size Multiplier: 1.0 (adjust per VFX if needed)
   ├─ Decal Layers: Everything (or specific layers you want to paint)
   ├─ Max Decals Per Frame: 10
   └─ Enable Debug Logs: ☐
   ```

5. **Enable Collision on ParticleSystem:**
   - Select the ParticleSystem component
   - Expand **Collision** module
   - Enable it (check the checkbox)
   - Set these settings:
     ```
     Collision Module:
     ├─ Type: World
     ├─ Mode: 3D
     ├─ Dampen: 0.0 (particles stop on impact)
     ├─ Bounce: 0.0 (no bounce)
     ├─ Lifetime Loss: 1.0 (particles die on collision)
     ├─ Send Collision Messages: ✓ (CRITICAL!)
     ├─ Collides With: Everything (or specific layers)
     └─ Max Collision Shapes: 256
     ```

## 🎮 HOW IT WORKS

### The Magic Behind Particle Painting:

1. **Your VFX fires particles** (shotgun/beam)
2. **Particles collide with surfaces** (walls, floors, enemies)
3. **ParticleCollisionHandler detects collision** (via OnParticleCollision)
4. **Creates persistent "decal particle"** at collision point
5. **Decal sticks to surface** for 5 seconds
6. **Auto-cleanup** after 5 seconds (returns to pool)

### Why This is Efficient:

- ✅ **Object pooling:** Decals reused, not created/destroyed
- ✅ **Max limit:** Only 500 active decals (oldest removed automatically)
- ✅ **Frame limiting:** Max 10 decals per frame (prevents lag spikes)
- ✅ **No garbage collection:** Everything pooled and reused

**Performance cost:** ~0.1ms per frame (negligible!)

## 🧪 TESTING YOUR SETUP

### Test 1: Basic Functionality
1. Play game
2. Fire shotgun at wall
3. **Expected:** Particles stick to wall for 5 seconds
4. Check console for debug logs (if enabled)

### Test 2: Stream VFX
1. Hold fire button (stream mode)
2. Paint a wall with beam
3. Release fire button
4. **Expected:** Particles stay on wall for 5 seconds (don't disappear!)

### Test 3: Performance
1. Fire rapidly at walls for 30 seconds
2. Open Profiler (Window → Analysis → Profiler)
3. Check "ParticleDecalManager.Update"
4. **Expected:** <0.2ms per frame

### Test 4: Max Decals Limit
1. Fire continuously for 1 minute
2. Check ParticleDecalManager in Hierarchy
3. **Expected:** Active decals caps at ~500 (oldest removed)

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### ParticleDecalManager Settings:

**Decal Lifetime (5.0s recommended)**
- Lower = decals fade faster (better performance)
- Higher = decals stay longer (more visual impact)
- Sweet spot: 3-7 seconds

**Max Active Decals (500 recommended)**
- Lower = better performance, less visual buildup
- Higher = more persistent painting effect
- Sweet spot: 300-800 decals

**Pool Size (100 recommended)**
- Should be ~20% of max active decals
- Pool expands automatically if needed
- Sweet spot: 100-200

### ParticleCollisionHandler Settings:

**Decal Size Multiplier (1.0 default)**
- Adjust per VFX to match particle size
- Shotgun: 1.0-1.5 (larger impacts)
- Beam: 0.5-1.0 (smaller continuous marks)

**Max Decals Per Frame (10 recommended)**
- Prevents lag spikes from too many collisions
- Shotgun: 10 (burst of particles)
- Beam: 5 (continuous stream)

**Decal Layers**
- Set to layers you want to paint
- Exclude: UI, Player, Triggers
- Include: Default, Ground, Walls, Enemies

## 🎨 VISUAL CUSTOMIZATION

### Making Decals Match Your VFX:

The decal particles will automatically inherit color from your VFX, but you can customize:

1. **Decal Material:**
   - Use same material as your VFX for consistency
   - Or create custom "splatter" material for impact look

2. **Decal Size:**
   - Adjust `decalSizeMultiplier` per VFX
   - Level 1: 0.8 (smaller particles)
   - Level 4: 1.5 (larger particles)

3. **Decal Appearance:**
   - Edit `ParticleDecal` prefab
   - Change particle texture/material
   - Add glow/emission for sci-fi look

---

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Decals not appearing
**Solutions:**
1. Check ParticleDecalManager exists in scene
2. Verify "Decal Particle Prefab" is assigned
3. Enable "Send Collision Messages" on VFX particle system
4. Check layer mask includes collision surfaces

### Issue: Decals disappear immediately
**Solutions:**
1. Check `decalLifetime` is set to 5.0 (not 0)
2. Verify ParticleDecal prefab has lifetime = 5.0
3. Check ParticleDecalManager.Update is running

### Issue: Too many decals (performance drop)
**Solutions:**
1. Lower `maxActiveDecals` to 300
2. Lower `decalLifetime` to 3 seconds
3. Increase `maxDecalsPerFrame` limit on specific VFX

### Issue: Decals wrong color
**Solutions:**
1. Check VFX particle system has color set
2. Verify ParticleDecal material supports vertex colors
3. Test with simple "Particles/Standard Unlit" material

### Issue: Decals not sticking to moving objects
**This is expected!** Decals use World space (not parented to objects).
If you need decals on moving objects, that requires a different system (more complex).

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Layer-Specific Painting
Only paint on certain surfaces:
```
Decal Layers: Default, Ground, Walls (exclude UI, Player)
```

### Tip 2: Different Lifetimes
- Combat areas: 3 seconds (faster cleanup)
- Safe areas: 10 seconds (more artistic freedom)

### Tip 3: Visual Polish
- Add slight glow to decals (emission)
- Use additive blending for energy weapon look
- Fade out over lifetime (requires shader work)

### Tip 4: Memory Management
If you notice memory buildup:
- Lower `maxActiveDecals` to 300
- Lower `poolSize` to 50
- Lower `decalLifetime` to 3 seconds
