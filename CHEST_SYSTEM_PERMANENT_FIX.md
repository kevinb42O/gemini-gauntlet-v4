# Chest System - PERMANENT FIX

## All Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### Issue #1: First Interaction Requires Two Presses ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Had to press E twice - once to start animation, once to open UI.

**Solution:** Modified `ChestController.PlayerInteract()` to:
- Start opening animation immediately
- Set state to `Interacted` on first press
- Return `true` immediately to open inventory UI
- Animation plays in background while UI is already open

**Result:** Single E press now opens both animation AND UI simultaneously.

---

### Issue #2: Player Movement Disabled ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Player couldn't move when chest was open, preventing auto-close feature.

**Solution:** Changed from disabling all player scripts to **selective disabling**:
- ‚úÖ **Movement ENABLED** - Player can walk/sprint away
- üö´ **Camera Look DISABLED** - Can't look around with mouse
- üö´ **Shooting DISABLED** - Can't fire weapons

**New Inspector Fields:**
- `cameraController` - Assign `AAACameraController` component
- `shooterScript` - Assign `PlayerShooterOrchestrator` component

**Result:** Player can now walk away from chest while browsing inventory.

---

### Issue #3: Auto-Close Not Working ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Walking away from chest didn't auto-close the UI.

**Root Cause:** Player movement was disabled, so distance check never triggered.

**Solution:** 
- Movement now enabled (see Issue #2)
- Movement threshold set to `2.5 units` (reasonable walking distance)
- `CheckPlayerMovement()` runs every frame when chest is open
- Automatically closes chest UI when player moves beyond threshold

**Result:** Walk 2.5 units away and chest UI auto-closes.

## Technical Changes

### ChestController.cs

**Before (BUGGY):**
```csharp
if (chestType == ChestType.Manual && currentState == ChestState.Closed)
{
    SetChestState(ChestState.Open);
    StartCoroutine(OpeningSequence());
    // Fall through...
}
if (currentState != ChestState.Open) return false;
SetChestState(ChestState.Interacted);
return true;
```

**After (FIXED):**
```csharp
if (chestType == ChestType.Manual && currentState == ChestState.Closed)
{
    StartCoroutine(OpeningSequence()); // Animation
    SetChestState(ChestState.Interacted); // UI opens immediately
    // Mission tracking and sounds...
    return true; // ‚úÖ Opens UI on first press!
}
```

### ChestInteractionSystem.cs

**Key Changes:**
1. **Removed:** `playerScriptsToDisable[]` array
2. **Added:** `cameraController` and `shooterScript` fields
3. **New Method:** `DisablePlayerCombatAndLook()` - Disables only camera + shooting
4. **New Method:** `EnablePlayerCombatAndLook()` - Re-enables camera + shooting
5. **Movement Threshold:** Changed from `0.1f` to `2.5f` units

## Setup Instructions

### In Unity Inspector:

1. **Find ChestInteractionSystem GameObject** (usually on GameManager or similar)

2. **Assign Camera Controller:**
   - Find the field: `Camera Controller`
   - Drag the `AAACameraController` component from your Player
   - This disables mouse look when chest is open

3. **Assign Shooter Script:**
   - Find the field: `Shooter Script`
   - Drag the `PlayerShooterOrchestrator` component from your Player
   - This disables shooting when chest is open

4. **Verify Movement Threshold:**
   - Should be set to `2.5` (default)
   - Increase if you want player to walk further before auto-close
   - Decrease if you want chest to close sooner

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: First Interaction
- [ ] Approach a closed chest
- [ ] Press E **once**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Chest lid should start opening
- [ ] ‚úÖ Inventory UI should appear immediately
- [ ] ‚úÖ Chest panel should appear immediately
- [ ] ‚úÖ Only 2 sounds should play (interaction + opening)

### Test 2: Movement While Chest Open
- [ ] Open a chest
- [ ] Try to move with WASD
- [ ] ‚úÖ Player should be able to walk/sprint
- [ ] ‚úÖ Camera should NOT move with mouse
- [ ] ‚úÖ Shooting should NOT work

### Test 3: Auto-Close on Walk Away
- [ ] Open a chest
- [ ] Walk away from chest (about 3-4 steps)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Chest UI should auto-close
- [ ] ‚úÖ Inventory UI should auto-close
- [ ] ‚úÖ Camera look should re-enable
- [ ] ‚úÖ Shooting should re-enable

### Test 4: Manual Close with E
- [ ] Open a chest
- [ ] Press E again
- [ ] ‚úÖ Chest UI should close
- [ ] ‚úÖ Inventory UI should close
- [ ] ‚úÖ Camera and shooting should re-enable

### Test 5: Spawned Chests (After Platform Clear)
- [ ] Clear a platform of enemies
- [ ] Wait for chest to emerge and open
- [ ] Press E once
- [ ] ‚úÖ Inventory should open immediately
- [ ] ‚úÖ Same behavior as manual chests

## Debug Logs

When chest opens, you should see:
```
üö´ Disabled camera look: AAACameraController
üö´ Disabled shooting: PlayerShooterOrchestrator
‚úÖ Player can still MOVE but cannot LOOK or SHOOT while chest is open
```

When walking away:
```
üö∂ Player moved 2.87 units away from chest (threshold: 2.5) - auto-closing chest UI
```

When chest closes:
```
‚úÖ Re-enabled camera look: AAACameraController
‚úÖ Re-enabled shooting: PlayerShooterOrchestrator
```

## Important Notes

### Movement Threshold Tuning
- **Current:** `2.5 units` (about 3-4 steps)
- **Too sensitive?** Increase to `3.5` or `4.0`
- **Not sensitive enough?** Decrease to `1.5` or `2.0`

### Camera Controller Assignment
- **Must assign** `AAACameraController` in Inspector
- If not assigned, you'll see warning: `‚ö†Ô∏è No camera controller assigned!`
- Camera look won't be disabled (player can still look around)

### Shooter Script Assignment
- **Must assign** `PlayerShooterOrchestrator` in Inspector
- If not assigned, you'll see warning: `‚ö†Ô∏è No shooter script assigned!`
- Shooting won't be disabled (player can still shoot)
