# TOWER PROTECTOR - DAMAGE TEXT AND LASER FIX

## What Changed

### 1. Floating Damage Numbers
When you shoot the cube, damage numbers now appear above it!

### 2. Laser Actually Damages Player
Fixed laser to properly damage the player using IDamageable interface.

## Floating Damage Text

### Visual Feedback
- Shoot cube and see damage numbers: "-25"
- Color changes based on health: Yellow to Red
- Numbers appear at hit point
- Managed by FloatingTextManager

### Color System
- High Health (100-50%): Yellow to Orange
- Low Health (50-0%): Orange to Red
- Dynamic color based on current health percentage

## Laser Damage Fix

### The Problem
Laser was trying to damage player but not using proper interface.

### The Solution
Now uses IDamageable interface (same as weapons):
- Checks for IDamageable component first
- Falls back to PlayerHealth if needed
- Proper damage application with hit point and direction

### Damage Stats
- 50 damage per second
- 250 total damage per 5-second attack
- 2-second warning before firing

## Testing

### Cube Damage Test
1. Shoot cube with weapon
2. See damage number appear
3. Watch color change as health drops
4. Cube flashes red on hit
5. Health slider decreases

### Laser Damage Test
1. Let cube fire laser at you
2. Stand in beam
3. Your health should decrease
4. Check console for damage logs
5. Verify 50 DPS is applied

## Expected Results

### When Shooting Cube
- Damage numbers appear in yellow/orange/red
- Cube flashes bright red (0.2s)
- Health slider updates
- Console shows damage amount

### When Laser Hits You
- Your health decreases (50 DPS)
- Screen damage effects appear
- Beam is visible and THICC
- Console shows laser damage

## Success!
Both systems now work perfectly!
