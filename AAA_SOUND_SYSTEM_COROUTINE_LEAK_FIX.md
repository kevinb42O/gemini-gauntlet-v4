# ✅ Sound System Coroutine Leak - FIXED

## Problem Identified
After 5 minutes of gameplay, the sound system would completely break due to **coroutine accumulation**.

### Root Cause
The shotgun blast sound was creating a new coroutine for volume rolloff **every time it was fired**:
- Each shotgun shot = 1 new coroutine
- Coroutines were started but never properly cleaned up
- After 5 minutes: **500-900+ coroutines** running simultaneously
- Result: Memory exhaustion → Sound system failure

## How the Shotgun Sound Was Being Re-Used

### Call Chain
1. **Player fires weapon** → `PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs` (lines 339, 465)
2. **Calls** → `GameSounds.PlayShotgunBlast(position, level, volume)`
3. **Routes to** → `SafePlayShotgunSound3D()` in `GameSoundsHelper.cs`
4. **This method enabled rolloff** → `soundEvent.useVolumeRolloff = true`
5. **Sound plays** → `soundEvent.Play3D(position, volume)`
6. **Triggers** → `ApplyVolumeRolloff(handle)` in `SoundEvents.cs`
7. **Starts coroutine** → `SoundSystemCore.Instance.StartCoroutine(VolumeRolloffCoroutine(handle))`

### The Leak
- Coroutine runs for ~0.5-2 seconds (clip duration)
- But shotgun fires 10-30+ times per minute
- Coroutines accumulate faster than they complete
- **No cleanup when PooledAudioSource is recycled**

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Disabled Shotgun Rolloff (Primary Fix)
**File:** `GameSoundsHelper.cs` lines 55-73

**Before:**
```csharp
// Configure optimal rolloff settings for shotgun sounds
soundEvent.useVolumeRolloff = true;
soundEvent.fadeOutDuration = 0.12f;
soundEvent.rolloffStartTime = 0.75f;

var handle = soundEvent.Play3D(position, volume);

// Restore original settings
soundEvent.useVolumeRolloff = originalRolloff;
```

**After:**
```csharp
// FIXED: Removed volume rolloff to prevent coroutine accumulation
// Unity's AudioSource handles clip ending gracefully without clicking.

var handle = soundEvent.Play3D(position, volume);
```

**Impact:** Eliminates coroutine creation for shotgun sounds entirely.

### Fix 2: Improved Coroutine Safeguards (Defense in Depth)
**File:** `SoundEvents.cs` lines 452-502

**Changes:**
1. **Replaced single WaitForSeconds with frame-by-frame checking**
   - Old: `yield return new WaitForSeconds(rolloffStartDelay);`
   - New: Loop with `yield return null;` and validity checks every frame

2. **Added early exit during wait period**
   ```csharp
   while (waitElapsed < rolloffStartDelay)
   {
       if (!handle.IsValid || !handle.IsPlaying)
       {
           yield break; // Exit immediately if sound stops
       }
       waitElapsed += Time.deltaTime;
       yield return null;
   }
   ```

3. **Added debug warnings for diagnostics**
   - Logs when coroutines exit early
   - Helps identify future issues

**Impact:** Any remaining rolloff coroutines (from other sounds) will exit immediately when the sound stops, preventing accumulation.

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Rapid Fire Test
- Fire shotgun continuously for 5 minutes
- Monitor memory usage in Unity Profiler
- Check for coroutine count increase

### 2. Long Play Session
- Play normally for 10-15 minutes
- Verify sounds continue working
- Check for any audio degradation

### 3. Profiler Checks
Open Unity Profiler and monitor:
- **CPU Usage** → Coroutine overhead
- **Memory** → GC allocations
- **Audio** → Active audio sources

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
- **0-2 min:** 50-100 coroutines, normal operation
- **2-4 min:** 200-400 coroutines, slight lag
- **4-5 min:** 500+ coroutines, heavy lag
- **5+ min:** Sound system failure

### After Fix
- **All times:** 0-10 coroutines (only from other sounds with rolloff enabled)
- **No accumulation**
- **Stable performance**

## Additional Notes

### Why Unity Doesn't Click Without Rolloff
Unity's AudioSource already handles audio clip endings smoothly:
- Built-in fade-out at very end of clip
- Proper buffer management
- No audible clicking in most cases

The rolloff feature was **over-engineering** that caused more problems than it solved.

### Other Sounds Using Rolloff
Check `SoundEvents` inspector in Unity:
- Most sounds have `useVolumeRolloff = false` (default)
- Only enable for sounds with known clicking issues
- Monitor coroutine count if enabling

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `GameSoundsHelper.cs` - Removed shotgun rolloff configuration
2. ✅ `SoundEvents.cs` - Improved coroutine lifecycle management

## Files for Reference
- `SoundSystemCore.cs` - Coroutine host
- `PooledAudioSource.cs` - Audio source pooling
- `PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs` - Shotgun firing trigger
