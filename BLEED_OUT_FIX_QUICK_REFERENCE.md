# 🚀 BLEED OUT FIX - QUICK REFERENCE

## TL;DR: Camera No Longer Spins! ✅

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS DONE

**Problem:** Camera spinning crazy during bleed out from mouse input  
**Root Cause:** AAAMovementController and CleanAAACrouch still active  
**Solution:** Disable them externally, use simple keyboard-only controller  

---

## 📁 NEW FILES

### **BleedOutMovementController.cs** ⭐
- **Location:** `Assets/scripts/BleedOutMovementController.cs`
- **Purpose:** Ultra-simple keyboard-only crawling (WASD)
- **Activation:** Automatically by DeathCameraController
- **Auto-Attached:** Yes (if missing on player)

---

## 🔧 MODIFIED FILES

### **DeathCameraController.cs** 🎥
**Changes:**
- ✅ Auto-finds AAAMovementController and CleanAAACrouch
- ✅ Disables both controllers on bleed out start
- ✅ Activates BleedOutMovementController
- ✅ Re-enables everything on revival
- ✅ Removed mouse input from camera (fixed overhead view)

**Key Methods:**
- `StartBleedOutCameraMode()` - Disables controllers, enables bleed out
- `StopDeathSequence()` - Re-enables controllers, restores FPS mode
- `UpdateBleedOutCamera()` - No mouse input, fixed overhead

---

## 🎮 HOW TO TEST

### **1. Play Your Game**
```
1. Take fatal damage
2. Enter bleeding out mode
3. Watch console for confirmation messages
```

### **2. During Bleed Out**
```
✅ Camera should be LOCKED overhead (no spinning!)
✅ WASD keys should move character smoothly
✅ Character rotates to face movement direction
✅ No mouse input affects anything
```

### **3. Console Messages:**
```
[DeathCameraController] 🔴 DISABLED AAAMovementController (was True)
[DeathCameraController] 🔴 DISABLED CleanAAACrouch (was True)
[BleedOutMovement] ✅ ACTIVATED - Keyboard-only crawl movement enabled
```

### **4. After Revival**
```
✅ AAAMovementController should be working (full FPS control)
✅ CleanAAACrouch should be working (can crouch)
✅ Main camera back to FPS view
✅ Everything works perfectly!
```

### **5. Console Messages on Revival:**
```
[DeathCameraController] ✅ RE-ENABLED AAAMovementController (restored to True)
[DeathCameraController] ✅ RE-ENABLED CleanAAACrouch (restored to True)
[BleedOutMovement] ✅ DEACTIVATED - Keyboard crawl movement disabled
```

## 🎮 CONTROLS DURING BLEED OUT

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **W** | Crawl Forward |

| **D** | Crawl Right |
| **Mouse** | ❌ DISABLED |

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Camera Still Spinning?**
1. Check console for controller disable messages
2. Verify BleedOutMovementController exists on player GameObject
3. Check that DeathCameraController is on scene

### **Can't Move During Bleed Out?**
1. Check console for "BleedOutMovementController ACTIVATED" message
2. Verify WASD keys work in Unity Input Manager
3. Check CharacterController is enabled on player

### **Controllers Not Working After Revival?**
1. Check console for "RE-ENABLED" messages
2. Verify PlayerHealth calls `StopDeathSequence()`
3. Check state flags in DeathCameraController
