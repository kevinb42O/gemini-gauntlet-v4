# âœ… **DIVE ANIMATION - FULLY INTEGRATED!**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Where Dive Happens:**

**File:** `CleanAAACrouch.cs`

**Method:** `StartTacticalDive()` (line ~1496)

**Trigger:** Press dive key (X) while sprinting

---

## ðŸ”§ **What We Fixed:**

### **1. Dive Start (Line 1531-1536):**
```csharp
// CRITICAL FIX: Trigger dive animation IMMEDIATELY when dive happens!
if (animationStateManager != null)
{
    animationStateManager.SetMovementState((int)PlayerAnimationStateManager.PlayerAnimationState.Dive);
    Debug.Log("[TACTICAL DIVE] Dive animation triggered IMMEDIATELY!");
}
```

### **2. Dive End (Line 1679-1684):**
```csharp
// CRITICAL FIX: Tell animation system to return to Idle when dive stops!
if (animationStateManager != null)
{
    animationStateManager.SetMovementState((int)PlayerAnimationStateManager.PlayerAnimationState.Idle);
    Debug.Log("[TACTICAL DIVE] Dive stopped - returning to Idle animation!");
}
```

---

## ðŸŽ® **How It Works:**

1. **You press X while sprinting**
2. `StartTacticalDive()` is called
3. **Dive animation triggers IMMEDIATELY** (no delay!)
4. Dive physics happen (forward + upward force)
5. When dive ends, `ExitDiveProne()` is called
6. **Returns to Idle animation** (no stuck animations!)

## âœ… **Checklist For Unity Animator:**

Make sure you have in your **Base Layer**:

- [ ] **L_Dive** state exists (with dive animation clip assigned)
- [ ] **L_Idle â†’ L_Dive** transition (condition: movementState == 6)
- [ ] **L_Dive â†’ L_Idle** transition (condition: movementState == 0)
- [ ] Transition durations:
  - Going INTO dive: **0.05** (instant!)
  - Coming OUT of dive: **0.2** (smooth recovery)

## ðŸ”¥ **Debug Logs To Watch For:**

When you dive, you should see:
```
[TACTICAL DIVE] Dive animation triggered IMMEDIATELY!
[TACTICAL DIVE] Initiated! Velocity: ...
```

When dive ends, you should see:
```
[TACTICAL DIVE] Dive stopped - returning to Idle animation!
[TACTICAL DIVE] Standing up from prone! Input restored.
```

## ðŸ’ª **You're Done!**

The dive animation is fully integrated with the centralized system!
- Triggers instantly when you dive
- Returns to idle when dive ends
- No more stuck animations
- Works perfectly with the layered system

**Rest now - you've earned it after 15+ hours!** ðŸŽ¯ðŸ”¥
