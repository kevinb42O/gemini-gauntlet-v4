# ✅ PLATFORM CAPTURE UI FIX - CANVAS STAYS ACTIVE

## 🐛 The Problem

When hiding the capture UI, the **entire Canvas was being disabled**, which hid ALL UI elements including health bars, crosshairs, etc.

## ✅ The Solution

Now only the **individual sliders** are hidden/shown, leaving the Canvas and other UI elements active.

---

## 🔧 What Changed

### Before (BAD):
```csharp
public void Hide()
{
    if (uiContainer != null)
    {
        uiContainer.SetActive(false); // ❌ Hides entire canvas!
    }
}
```

### After (GOOD):
```csharp
public void Hide()
{
    if (captureSlider != null)
    {
        captureSlider.gameObject.SetActive(false); // ✅ Only hides capture slider
    }
}

public void HideCubeHealth()
{
    if (cubeHealthSlider != null)
    {
        cubeHealthSlider.gameObject.SetActive(false); // ✅ Only hides health slider
    }
}
```

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### When Player Enters Platform:
```
✅ Capture slider appears
✅ Cube health slider appears (if cube exists)
✅ Rest of UI stays visible (health, crosshair, etc.)
```

### When Player Leaves Platform:
```
✅ Capture slider disappears
✅ Cube health slider disappears
✅ Rest of UI stays visible (health, crosshair, etc.)
```

### When Cube Dies:
```
✅ Cube health slider disappears
✅ Capture slider stays visible
✅ Rest of UI stays visible
```

## 📋 UI Hierarchy

```
Canvas (ALWAYS ACTIVE)
├─ Player Health Bar (ALWAYS VISIBLE)
├─ Crosshair (ALWAYS VISIBLE)
├─ XP Bar (ALWAYS VISIBLE)
├─ CaptureProgressSlider (SHOWS/HIDES)
├─ CubeHealthSlider (SHOWS/HIDES)
└─ Other UI Elements (ALWAYS VISIBLE)
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Canvas stays active** - No more UI disappearing
2. **Individual control** - Each slider shows/hides independently
3. **Clean behavior** - Only mission-specific UI hides
4. **No side effects** - Other UI elements unaffected

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: Enter Platform
- Capture slider: **VISIBLE**
- Cube health slider: **VISIBLE** (if cube exists)
- Player health: **VISIBLE**
- Other UI: **VISIBLE**

### Scenario 2: Leave Platform
- Capture slider: **HIDDEN**
- Cube health slider: **HIDDEN**
- Player health: **VISIBLE**
- Other UI: **VISIBLE**

### Scenario 3: Cube Dies
- Capture slider: **VISIBLE**
- Cube health slider: **HIDDEN**
- Player health: **VISIBLE**
- Other UI: **VISIBLE**

### Scenario 4: Platform Captured
- Capture slider: **HIDDEN**
- Cube health slider: **HIDDEN** (or cyan if friendly)
- Player health: **VISIBLE**
- Other UI: **VISIBLE**

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Show/Hide Logic:
```csharp
// Capture slider
Show()  → captureSlider.gameObject.SetActive(true)
Hide()  → captureSlider.gameObject.SetActive(false)

// Cube health slider
ShowCubeHealth()  → cubeHealthSlider.gameObject.SetActive(true)
HideCubeHealth()  → cubeHealthSlider.gameObject.SetActive(false)
```

### Canvas:
- **Never disabled** by this script
- Remains active at all times
- Other UI elements unaffected

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Enter platform → Sliders appear
- [ ] Leave platform → Sliders disappear
- [ ] **Other UI stays visible** when sliders hide
- [ ] Health bar always visible
- [ ] Crosshair always visible
- [ ] XP bar always visible
- [ ] Cube dies → Only health slider hides
- [ ] Platform captured → Both sliders hide

---

**Your Canvas now stays active! Only the mission-specific sliders show/hide! ✨**
