# 🔊 SWORD MODE - SOUND EFFECTS SYSTEM

**Feature**: Four-sound system for immersive sword combat audio
**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented and Ready to Configure

---

## 🎵 WHAT IT DOES

The sword system now plays **FOUR different sounds** for complete audio feedback:

### 1. ✨ **Sword Unsheath Sound** (swordUnsheath) ⭐
- **When**: When you press Backspace to ACTIVATE sword mode
- **Purpose**: Epic moment of drawing your sword (⭐ in the eyes!)
- **Location**: Plays at player position in 3D space
- **Example**: "SHING!" or "SHWIIING!" or metallic scrape

### 2. 🗡️ **Sword Swing Sound** (swordSwing)
- **When**: Every time you click RMB to attack
- **Purpose**: Immediate feedback that you initiated an attack (whoosh/swoosh sound)
- **Location**: Plays at sword position in 3D space
- **Example**: "Whoooosh!" or "Swwwwish!"

### 3. 💥 **Enemy Hit Sound** (swordHitEnemy)
- **When**: Sword connects with an enemy or gem (damageable target)
- **Purpose**: Satisfying impact feedback for successful hit
- **Location**: Plays at sword position in 3D space
- **Example**: "THUNK!" or "SLASH!" or "CRACK!"

### 4. 🔨 **Wall Hit Sound** (swordHitWall)
- **When**: Sword hits non-damageable objects (walls, props, terrain)
- **Purpose**: Environmental feedback for missed swings
- **Location**: Plays at sword position in 3D space
- **Example**: "Clang!" or "Scraaaape!" or "Tink!"

## 🎯 SOUND LOGIC

The system intelligently chooses which sound to play:

```
Player presses BACKSPACE
    ↓
✨ SWORD UNSHEATH SOUND (⭐ in the eyes!)
    ↓
Sword mode activated → Visual sword appears
    ↓
Player clicks RMB (Sword Mode)
    ↓
🗡️ SWORD SWING SOUND plays immediately
    ↓
Damage detection sphere checks for hits
    ↓
    ├─ Hit Enemy/Gem? → 💥 ENEMY HIT SOUND
    ├─ Hit Wall/Prop? → 🔨 WALL HIT SOUND
    └─ Hit Nothing?   → (Only swing sound plays)
```

### Technical Details:
- **Unsheath sound**: Plays once when entering sword mode (Backspace)
- **Swing sound**: Always plays on attack trigger
- **Impact sounds**: Only ONE plays per attack:
  - Priority 1: Enemy/Gem hit (if any damageable was hit)
  - Priority 2: Wall hit (if colliders detected but none damageable)
  - Priority 3: None (if no colliders detected - swing through air)

## 🛠️ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Find Your SoundEvents ScriptableObject
1. In Unity Project window, search for "SoundEvents" (type: ScriptableObject)
2. Likely location: `Assets/Audio/` or `Assets/Resources/Audio/`
3. Double-click to select it

### Step 2: Assign Your Four Sword Sounds
In the Inspector for **SoundEvents**, find the section:

```
► COMBAT: Sword
├─ Sword Unsheath      [Drag your unsheath/draw sound here] ⭐
├─ Sword Swing         [Drag your whoosh sound here]
├─ Sword Hit Enemy     [Drag your impact sound here]
└─ Sword Hit Wall      [Drag your clang sound here]
```

### Step 3: Configure Each Sound Event
For each of the four sounds, expand the sound event and configure:

#### ✨ Sword Unsheath (Recommended Settings):
```
Audio Clip:          [Your unsheath/draw sound - "SHING!"]

   - Listen for **SHING!** unsheath sound ⭐
   - Sword appears visually
3. Click RMB to attack:
   - Listen for **whoosh** sound immediately
   - Swing near enemy → hear **impact** sound
   - Swing at wall → hear **clang** sound
   - Swing at air → only **whoosh** (no impact)

## 🎨 SOUND DESIGN TIPS

### Sword Unsheath Sound:
**Good Examples**:
- Classic metallic "SHING!" (0.5-1.0s duration)
- Blade sliding from scabbard scrape
- Epic orchestral stinger layered with metal
- Slight reverb for dramatic effect
- Can add satisfying "click" at end (fully drawn)

**Avoid**:
- Too long (delays feedback)
- Sounds like a sword swing (that's different)
- Quiet/wimpy sounds (this is an epic moment!)

### Sword Swing Sound:
**Good Examples**:
- Fast whoosh (0.2-0.4s duration)
- Air displacement sound
- Light "swish" for fast attacks
- Can layer subtle blade hum

**Avoid**:
- Long drawn-out sounds (cuts off with rapid attacks)
- Sounds that imply impact (that's the hit sound's job)

### Enemy Hit Sound:
**Good Examples**:
- Meaty "thunk" for flesh hits
- Sharp "crack" for bone/skull hits
- Satisfying "crunch" with blood squish
- Can layer blood splatter sound

**Avoid**:
- Metal clang (that's for walls)
- Sounds too similar to swing whoosh

### Wall Hit Sound:
**Good Examples**:
- Metal sword on stone "clang"
- Scraping metal on wall
- Sharp "tink" for light glances
- Reverb for enclosed spaces

**Avoid**:
- Flesh impact sounds (confusing feedback)
- Sounds identical to enemy hits

## 🎵 ADVANCED AUDIO CONFIGURATION

### Pitch Variation for Variety
Add natural variety to prevent repetitive audio:
```
Swing Sound:       Pitch Variation = 0.1  (subtle)
Enemy Hit Sound:   Pitch Variation = 0.15 (moderate)
Wall Hit Sound:    Pitch Variation = 0.2  (noticeable)
```

### Volume Balance
Create audio hierarchy for clear feedback:
```
Unsheath:   0.9   (epic and noticeable - special moment!)
Enemy Hit:  1.0   (loudest - most important feedback)
Swing:      0.7   (medium - secondary feedback)
Wall Hit:   0.5   (quietest - less important)
```

### 3D Audio Settings
Make sounds feel spatial and realistic:

**Close Combat (Swing)**:
- Min Distance: 5 units
- Max Distance: 30 units
- Falloff: Natural distance attenuation

**Impactful Hits (Enemy)**:
- Min Distance: 10 units (louder up close)
- Max Distance: 50 units (hear from farther away)
- Falloff: Emphasis on presence

**Environmental (Wall)**:
- Min Distance: 5 units
- Max Distance: 25 units
- Falloff: Quick dropoff (less important)

---

## 🔧 CODE IMPLEMENTATION

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **SoundEvents.cs** (Audio Database)
Added three new sound event fields:
```csharp
[Header("► COMBAT: Sword")]
[Tooltip("Sound when sword swing starts (whoosh sound)")]
public SoundEvent swordSwing;

[Tooltip("Sound when sword hits an enemy or gem (satisfying impact)")]
public SoundEvent swordHitEnemy;

[Tooltip("Sound when sword hits a wall or other non-damageable object (clang/scrape)")]
public SoundEvent swordHitWall;
```

#### 2. **PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs** (Attack Trigger)
Plays swing sound when attack starts:
```csharp
// SOUND: Play sword swing sound (whoosh!)
if (SoundEventsManager.Events != null && SoundEventsManager.Events.swordSwing != null)
{
    SoundEventsManager.Events.swordSwing.Play3D(swordDamage.transform.position);
}
```

#### 3. **SwordDamage.cs** (Impact Detection)
Plays appropriate hit sound based on what was hit:
```csharp
if (damageCount > 0)
{
    // Hit enemy/gem - play impact sound
    SoundEventsManager.Events.swordHitEnemy?.Play3D(transform.position);
}
else if (hitSomething)
{
    // Hit wall - play clang sound
    SoundEventsManager.Events.swordHitWall?.Play3D(transform.position);
}
```

## 🎯 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Basic Sound Test:
1. ✅ Enter sword mode (Backspace)
2. ✅ Swing in air → Hear whoosh only
3. ✅ Hit enemy → Hear whoosh + impact
4. ✅ Hit wall → Hear whoosh + clang
5. ✅ Rapid attacks → Sounds don't overlap badly

### Volume Balance Test:
1. ✅ Enemy hit is loudest
2. ✅ Swing is audible but not overpowering
3. ✅ Wall hit is quieter than enemy hit

### 3D Audio Test:
1. ✅ Sounds get quieter with distance
2. ✅ Sounds come from sword position (not player center)
3. ✅ Left/right audio panning works correctly

### Variety Test:
1. ✅ Swing sounds slightly different each time (pitch variation)
2. ✅ Hit sounds have variety
3. ✅ Doesn't feel repetitive after 10+ swings

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: No sounds play at all
**Solution**:
1. Check SoundEventsManager exists in scene (singleton)
2. Verify SoundEvents ScriptableObject is assigned to SoundEventsManager
3. Check Console for "SoundEventsManager: Initialized with..." message
4. Verify audio clips are assigned in SoundEvents

### Problem: Only swing sound plays, no impact sounds
**Solution**:
1. Verify `swordHitEnemy` and `swordHitWall` are assigned in SoundEvents
2. Check Console for sword damage logs - should show "Playing enemy hit sound" or "Playing wall hit sound"
3. Enable SwordDamage debug logs to see what's being hit

### Problem: Wrong sound plays (wall sound when hitting enemy)
**Solution**:
1. Check that enemies have SkullEnemy or Gem component
2. Verify damage detection is working (check Console logs)
3. Order matters: damageCount check happens before hitSomething check

### Problem: Sounds overlap/cut each other off
**Solution**:
1. Add cooldown to sounds in SoundEvents (0.1-0.2s)
2. Reduce attack cooldown in SwordDamage component
3. Check that swing sound is short enough (< 0.5s)

### Problem: Sounds are too quiet/loud
**Solution**:
1. Adjust volume in SoundEvent settings (0.0 - 2.0 range)
2. Check Audio Mixer settings if using custom categories
3. Verify SFX category volume is appropriate

### Problem: Sounds don't feel 3D/spatial
**Solution**:
1. Enable "Use 3D Override" on each sound event
2. Increase Min/Max Distance values
3. Check camera has Audio Listener component
4. Verify sounds are using Play3D() not Play2D()

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Layered Sounds:
Create depth by using multiple audio clips:
- Swing = Whoosh + Subtle blade hum
- Enemy Hit = Impact thunk + Blood squish + Bone crack
- Wall Hit = Metal clang + Stone chip + Dust particles

### Dynamic Volume:
Adjust volume based on context:
```csharp
// In SwordDamage.cs, modify volume based on damage dealt
float volumeMultiplier = Mathf.Clamp(damageCount * 0.3f, 0.5f, 1.5f);
SoundEventsManager.Events.swordHitEnemy?.Play3D(transform.position, volumeMultiplier);
```

### Combo Audio:
Increase pitch for consecutive hits (combo feeling):
```csharp
// Track combo in SwordDamage
private int comboCount = 0;
private float lastHitTime = 0f;

// In DealDamage()
if (Time.time - lastHitTime < 1f) 
    comboCount++;
else 
    comboCount = 0;
    
float pitchBoost = 1f + (comboCount * 0.05f); // Pitch increases with combo
lastHitTime = Time.time;
```

### Slow-Motion Audio:
If you add slow-motion effects:
```csharp
Time.timeScale = 0.5f; // Slow-mo
AudioListener.pause = false; // Keep audio playing
// Manually pitch down sounds by 0.5x for dramatic effect
```
