# 🧠 INTELLIGENT COMBAT SYSTEM - AAA Quality!

## What I Fixed

Your enemies were acting like **turrets** - standing still and rotating. Now they're **intelligent fighters** that move dynamically!

---

## 🎯 New Behavior System

### 1. 🏃💨 HUNTING (No Line of Sight)
**Problem:** Detected you but can't see you  
**Behavior:**
- ✅ **AGGRESSIVELY CHASE** to get visual
- ✅ Position fake player **PAST** your location (runs through you)
- ✅ **FAST MOVEMENT** (engaging mode)
- ✅ **STOPS SHOOTING** (can't see target)
- ✅ **NEVER STOPS MOVING** until they see you

**Result:** Enemy will **hunt you down** like a real player!

---

### 2. 🏃🎯 CLOSING IN (Has LOS, Too Far)
**Problem:** Can see you but out of attack range  
**Behavior:**
- ✅ **ADVANCES** toward you
- ✅ Positions fake player **ahead** of you
- ✅ **KEEPS MOVING** to close distance
- ✅ Transitions to ATTACK when in range

**Result:** Enemy **closes the gap** aggressively!

---

### 3. ⚔️ DYNAMIC COMBAT (In Attack Range)

#### Too Close (< 50% of attack range):
- ✅ **RETREATS** while shooting
- ✅ Backs up to optimal distance
- ✅ Maintains line of sight

#### Too Far (> 150% of attack range):
- ✅ **ADVANCES** while shooting
- ✅ Closes to optimal distance
- ✅ Never lets you escape

#### Optimal Range:
- ✅ **STRAFES** left/right (changes direction every 2s)
- ✅ Shoots while moving
- ✅ Unpredictable movement

**Result:** Enemy **fights like a player** - moving, dodging, shooting!

---

### 4. 👁️❌ Lost Line of Sight
**During Combat:**
- ✅ **IMMEDIATELY** switches back to HUNTING
- ✅ Chases to regain visual
- ✅ Stops shooting (can't see you)

**Result:** Enemy **adapts** to your tactics!

---

## 🎮 Combat Flow

```
PATROL → Detect Player → HUNTING (chase)
   ↓
Has LOS? NO → Keep HUNTING (aggressive chase)
   ↓
Has LOS? YES → CLOSING IN (advance)
   ↓
In Range? YES → ATTACKING (dynamic combat)
   ↓
Lost LOS? → Back to HUNTING
   ↓
Too Close? → RETREAT while shooting
Too Far? → ADVANCE while shooting
Optimal? → STRAFE while shooting
```

## 💪 What Makes This AAA Quality

### 1. **Never Stands Still**
- Always moving during combat
- Advances, retreats, or strafes
- Like a real player

### 2. **Respects Line of Sight**
- Stops shooting when can't see you
- Chases to regain visual
- Doesn't shoot through walls

### 3. **Distance Management**
- Backs up if too close
- Advances if too far
- Maintains optimal combat range

### 4. **Tactical Movement**
- Strafes at optimal range
- Changes direction periodically
- Unpredictable patterns

### 5. **Adaptive Behavior**
- Switches states based on situation
- Hunts when loses sight
- Engages when has visual
- Retreats when overwhelmed

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Hunting Behavior:
```csharp
if (!hasLineOfSight)
{
    // Chase PAST player position
    _fakePlayerTransform.position = _realPlayerTransform.position + direction * 2000f;
    _companionMovement.SetEngagingMode(); // Fast!
    _companionCombat.StopAttacking(); // Can't see = don't shoot
}
```

### Dynamic Combat:
```csharp
if (distanceToPlayer < attackRange * 0.5f)
{
    // RETREAT
    _fakePlayerTransform.position = transform.position + retreatDirection * 1500f;
}
else if (distanceToPlayer > attackRange * 1.5f)
{
    // ADVANCE
    _fakePlayerTransform.position = _realPlayerTransform.position + advanceDirection * 500f;
}
else
{
    // STRAFE (changes every 2 seconds)
    _fakePlayerTransform.position = transform.position + strafeDirection * 1000f;
}
```

## 🧪 Test It

### Test 1: Hide Behind Wall
**Expected:** Enemy **chases** you, runs around wall to find you

### Test 2: Get Too Close
**Expected:** Enemy **backs up** while shooting

### Test 3: Run Away
**Expected:** Enemy **chases** and closes distance

### Test 4: Optimal Range
**Expected:** Enemy **strafes** left/right while shooting

### Test 5: Break Line of Sight
**Expected:** Enemy **stops shooting**, starts **hunting**
