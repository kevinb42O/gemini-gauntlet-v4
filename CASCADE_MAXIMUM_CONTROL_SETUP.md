## üéØ RECOMMENDED SETUP FOR MAXIMUM CONTROL

### **Step 1: Add to Player GameObject**
Add these components to your Player:
- ‚úÖ RuntimeAnimationLogger
- ‚úÖ ComponentConfigDumper
- ‚úÖ UnityEditorLogReader

### **Step 2: Add to Scene Manager or Empty GameObject**
- ‚úÖ SceneHierarchyExporter

### **Step 3: Use Editor Window**
- Open `Tools > Cascade Debug > Inspector Exporter`
- Keep window open for quick exports

### **Step 4: Configure Settings**
All components have sensible defaults, but you can customize:
- Log frequencies (lower = more data, higher = less spam)
- Hotkeys for manual exports
- What data to include/exclude

---

## üìÇ OUTPUT LOCATION

All exports save to:
```
[Your Project Root]/CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/
```

This folder is automatically created and is **OUTSIDE** the Assets folder, so it won't clutter your project!

---

## üî• QUICK START WORKFLOW

### **For Animation Issues:**
1. Add `RuntimeAnimationLogger` to Player
2. Press Play and reproduce the issue
3. Share the `Animation_Runtime_Log_[timestamp].txt` file with Cascade
4. Cascade can see EXACTLY what happened frame-by-frame!

### **For Inspector Configuration Issues:**
1. Open `Tools > Cascade Debug > Inspector Exporter`
2. Click "Export Player GameObject"
3. Share the export file with Cascade
4. Cascade can see EVERY Inspector value you've set!

### **For General Debugging:**
1. Add all components to Player
2. Press Play
3. All logs generate automatically
4. Share the entire `CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/` folder with Cascade
5. Cascade has COMPLETE VISIBILITY!

## üéÆ HOTKEY REFERENCE

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **F9** | Dump Component Configuration |
| **F10** | Export Scene Hierarchy |
| **F11** | Copy Unity Editor Log |

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

### **Tip #1: Export Before and After**
- Export Inspector config BEFORE making changes
- Reproduce issue
- Export AFTER issue occurs
- Cascade can see exactly what changed!

### **Tip #2: Use "Log Only On Change"**
- Keeps animation logs small and readable
- Only logs when something actually changes
- Perfect for finding specific issues

### **Tip #3: Share the Whole Folder**
- Just zip up `CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/` and share
- Contains everything Cascade needs
- No need to pick and choose files

### **Tip #4: Keep Logs Running**
- Leave `RuntimeAnimationLogger` enabled during play sessions
- Captures issues as they happen
- No need to reproduce issues multiple times

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"No files generated"**
- Check that components are enabled in Inspector
- Check that `enableLogging` is ON for runtime loggers
- Look for `CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/` folder in project root (not Assets)

### **"Too much data / files too large"**
- Increase `logFrequency` on RuntimeAnimationLogger (try 10 or 30)
- Enable `logOnlyOnChange` to reduce spam
- Disable specific logging features you don't need

### **"Can't find CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS folder"**
- It's in your project root: `Gemini Gauntlet - V3.0/CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/`
- Same level as Assets, Library, ProjectSettings folders
- Created automatically on first export

---

## üéâ RESULT

With this package, Cascade has:
- ‚úÖ Complete Inspector visibility
- ‚úÖ Real-time animation state tracking
- ‚úÖ Full console log access
- ‚úÖ Scene hierarchy understanding
- ‚úÖ Component configuration details
- ‚úÖ Material and shader properties
- ‚úÖ Transform and physics data

**THIS IS MAXIMUM CONTROL MODE!** üöÄ

Cascade can now see EVERYTHING happening in your Unity project, both in the Editor and at Runtime!

---

## üìù NEXT STEPS
