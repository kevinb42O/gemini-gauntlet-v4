# ⚡ WALL JUMP XP AUDIO - INSTANT FIX

## The sound isn't playing because you need to assign an audio clip!

### 🎯 3-Step Fix (30 seconds)

#### Step 1: Open SoundEvents
```
Unity → Project Window → Assets/audio/AudioMixer/SoundEvents.asset
```
Click on it to select it.

#### Step 2: Find the Field
In the **Inspector** window, scroll down to:
```
═══════════════════ PLAYER ═══════════════════
    ► PLAYER: Movement
        - Jump Sounds
        - Double Jump Sounds
        - Land Sounds
        - Wall Jump Sounds
        → Wall Jump XP Notification  ← THIS ONE!
```

#### Step 3: Assign Audio Clip
**Drag ANY audio clip** into the "Wall Jump XP Notification" field.

Suggested clips to try:
- Any UI notification sound
- Coin pickup sound
- Bell/chime sound
- Achievement sound

**Don't have a sound?** Use one of your existing sounds temporarily:
- Copy one from "Jump Sounds" array
- Copy one from "Gem Collection" sounds
- Any short, pleasant sound will work!

## ✅ That's It!

Enter Play Mode and wall jump. You should now hear the sound!

The pitch will automatically increase with higher chains:
- Chain 1: Normal pitch
- Chain 2: 10% higher
- Chain 3: 20% higher
- Chain 10: 90% higher!
