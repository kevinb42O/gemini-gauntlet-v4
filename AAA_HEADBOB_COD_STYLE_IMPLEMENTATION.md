# Call of Duty Style Headbob - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Replaced the old floaty sine-wave headbob with a realistic, grounded Call of Duty-style system that feels weighted and natural.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Realistic Motion Profile**
- **Sharp footstep impacts** instead of smooth sine waves
- **Velocity-based intensity** - bob scales with actual movement speed
- **Minimal horizontal sway** - COD uses very subtle side-to-side (not drunk camera)
- **Subtle forward lean** - adds momentum/weight feel during movement

### 2. **Advanced Features**
- **Step-based tilt** - camera tilts slightly on each footstep (left foot, right foot alternation)
- **Footstep sharpness control** - power curve for realistic weight transfer
- **Smooth transitions** - natural blending between walk/sprint/idle states
- **Sprint enhancement** - extra forward lean during sprint for intensity

### 3. **Technical Details**

#### Vertical Bob (Compression)
```
- Uses power curve: Mathf.Pow(Mathf.Sin(phase), sharpness)
- Creates sharp downward compression on footstep
- Smooth recovery between steps
- Default intensity: 0.015 (very subtle)
```

#### Horizontal Sway (Weight Shift)
```
- Minimal side-to-side motion
- Synchronized with footsteps
- Default intensity: 0.008 (extremely subtle)
- Full sine wave for smooth weight transfer
```

#### Forward Lean (Momentum)
```
- Subtle forward push during movement
- 1.5x multiplier during sprint
- Default intensity: 0.005
- Adds weight/momentum feel
```

#### Step Tilt (Weight Distribution)
```
- Alternates left/right per footstep
- Smooth spring-based return to neutral
- Default max angle: 0.8 degrees
- Can be disabled if too much
```

## Inspector Settings (Scaled for 320-Unit Character)

### Core Intensities (Scaled 6.4x for Large Character)
- **Vertical Intensity**: `12.0` - Downward compression on steps (scaled for 320-unit height)
- **Horizontal Intensity**: `6.0` - Side-to-side sway (scaled for 320-unit height)
- **Forward Intensity**: `4.0` - Forward momentum lean (scaled for 320-unit height)

### Frequencies (Steps per Second - Slower for Heavy Character)
- **Walk Frequency**: `1.4` - Slower cadence for large character mass
- **Sprint Frequency**: `2.0` - Slower sprint for heavy character

### Advanced Tuning
- **Velocity Influence**: `0.4` - Lower for smoother, more consistent motion
- **Smoothness**: `5` - Very smooth transitions (lower = smoother)
- **Footstep Sharpness**: `1.3` - Soft impacts for heavy character feel
- **Enable Step Tilt**: `true` - Subtle weight distribution
- **Max Step Tilt Angle**: `1.2¬∞` - Subtle tilt appropriate for large character

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Old System (Floaty)
```
‚ùå Simple sine waves
‚ùå Same intensity regardless of speed
‚ùå No weight feel
‚ùå Too much horizontal movement
‚ùå Felt like floating
```

### New System (Grounded)
```
‚úÖ Sharp footstep impacts
‚úÖ Velocity-based scaling
‚úÖ Realistic weight transfer
‚úÖ Minimal horizontal sway
‚úÖ Feels grounded and realistic
```

## Tuning Guide

### If Bob Feels Too Strong
- Reduce all intensities by 50%: `0.0075`, `0.004`, `0.0025`
- Lower `velocityInfluence` to `0.3`

### If Bob Feels Too Weak
- Increase all intensities by 50%: `0.0225`, `0.012`, `0.0075`
- Raise `velocityInfluence` to `0.8`

### If Steps Feel Too Sharp
- Lower `footstepSharpness` to `1.5` or `2.0`
- Increase `headBobSmoothness` to `20`

### If Tilt Is Distracting
- Disable `enableStepTilt`
- Or reduce `maxStepTiltAngle` to `0.4¬∞`

## Technical Implementation

### Velocity Detection
```csharp
Vector3 velocity = movementController.GetVelocity();
float horizontalSpeed = new Vector2(velocity.x, velocity.z).magnitude;
float speedRatio = Mathf.Clamp01(horizontalSpeed / maxSpeed);
```

### Footstep Detection
```csharp
float stepPhase = headBobTimer % 1f; // 0 to 1 per step
if (stepPhase < lastStepPhase) {
    // Footstep just occurred!
    ApplyStepTilt();
}
```

### Power Curve for Realism
```csharp
float verticalCurve = Mathf.Pow(Mathf.Sin(stepPhase * Mathf.PI), footstepSharpness);
// Creates sharp impact, smooth recovery
```

## Performance
- **Zero allocations** per frame
- **Minimal calculations** - simple math operations
- **Smooth 60+ FPS** - no performance impact

## Integration
- Automatically detects sprint state
- Works with energy system
- Respects grounded state
- Smooth transitions to/from idle

## Result
The headbob now feels like **Modern Warfare 2019** or **Warzone** - subtle, grounded, and realistic. The camera has weight and responds naturally to movement without being distracting or nauseating.
