# QUICK PAUSE MENU FIX

## The Problem
Your pause menu logic works perfectly, but you have the **WRONG PANEL ASSIGNED** in the UIManager inspector!

When you press F5, it shows the chest inventory panel instead of the pause menu. This means:
- The `pauseMenuPanel` field in UIManager is assigned to the chest inventory panel
- You need to find and assign the correct pause menu panel

## IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Add the Fixer Script
1. Add `PauseMenuFixer.cs` to any GameObject in your scene
2. Press **F8** in Play mode for emergency fix
3. Or press **F9** to list all UI panels

### Step 2: Manual Fix (Recommended)
1. **Find your UIManager GameObject** in the scene hierarchy
2. **Select it** and look at the Inspector
3. **Find the "Game State UI Panels" section**
4. **Look at what's assigned to "Pause Menu Panel"** - it's probably the chest panel!
5. **Find your actual pause menu panel** in the hierarchy (look for names like "PauseMenu", "PausePanel", etc.)
6. **Drag the correct pause menu panel** into the "Pause Menu Panel" field
7. **Test with Escape key**

### Step 3: If You Can't Find the Pause Menu Panel
The fixer script will create an emergency pause menu for you automatically.

```

## Common Wrong Assignments
- ChestInventoryPanel ❌
- InventoryPanel ❌  
- StashPanel ❌
- GameOverPanel ❌

## Correct Assignment Should Be
- PauseMenuPanel ✅
- PauseMenu ✅
- MainPauseMenu ✅
- GamePausePanel ✅

## Test After Fix
1. Press **Escape** - should show pause menu (not chest!)
2. Game should pause (Time.timeScale = 0)
3. Cursor should be visible and unlocked
4. Buttons should work

## If Still Not Working
The emergency fixer will create a new pause menu panel automatically. Just press F8 in Play mode!
