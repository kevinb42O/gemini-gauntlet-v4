## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Replace the Old System

1. **Disable the old CognitiveFeedManager**
   - Find your existing `CognitiveFeedManager` script
   - Disable it or remove it from the scene

2. **Add the Enhanced System**
   - Add `CognitiveFeedManagerEnhanced.cs` to an empty GameObject
   - Name it "Enhanced Cognitive Feed Manager"
   - Make sure it's set as DontDestroyOnLoad

### Step 2: Configure UI References

In the **CognitiveFeedManagerEnhanced** inspector:

1. **Core UI References**
   - Assign your `cognitiveText` (TextMeshProUGUI)
   - Assign your `cognitivePanelCanvasGroup` (CanvasGroup)
   - Assign your `persistentMessageText` (TextMeshProUGUI for item observations)
   - Assign your `persistentMessagePanelCanvasGroup` (CanvasGroup)

2. **Typewriter Settings**
   - Base Typing Speed: `15` (characters per second)
   - Fast Typing Speed: `30` (for excitement/urgency)
   - Slow Typing Speed: `8` (for thoughtful moments)
   - Adjust pause timings as desired

3. **Personality Settings**
   - Curiosity Level: `0.5` (how much it comments on discoveries)
   - Analytical Level: `0.7` (how much it analyzes behavior)
   - Sarcasm Level: `0.3` (personality flavor)
   - Support Level: `0.8` (how encouraging it is)

### Step 3: Add Integration Helper

1. **Add CognitiveFeedIntegration**
   - Add `CognitiveFeedIntegration.cs` to the same GameObject
   - Configure monitoring intervals in inspector
   - Set threshold values for health/inventory warnings

### Step 4: Enable Inventory Integration

1. **Verify UnifiedSlot Integration**
   - The `UnifiedSlot.cs` should already have the cognitive integration
   - If not, make sure the hover events call `CognitiveEvents.OnItemHoverStart/End`

2. **Test Item Hovering**
   - Hover over inventory items to see cognitive analysis
   - The system should show persistent messages about item properties

### Step 5: Audio Integration (Optional)

1. **Verify GameSounds Integration**
   - The system uses `GameSounds.PlayCognitiveFeedWord()` for typing sounds
   - Make sure your audio system supports this

## üéÆ How to Trigger Events

### From Other Scripts

You can trigger cognitive commentary from any script using the `CognitiveEvents` system:

```csharp
// Trigger item hover analysis
CognitiveEvents.OnItemHoverStart?.Invoke(itemData, slot);

// Notify about health changes
CognitiveEvents.TriggerHealthEvent("damage_taken", healthPercentage);

// Report combat events
CognitiveEvents.TriggerCombatAnalysis("enemy_defeated", enemyPosition);

// Trigger performance analysis
CognitiveEvents.TriggerPerformanceAnalysis("efficient_movement", 0.9f);

// Custom events
CognitiveEvents.TriggerCustomEvent("player_discovery", discoveryData);
```

### Automatic Integration

The system automatically hooks into:
- `PlayerHealth` events (damage, healing, death)
- `PlayerProgression` events (gem collection, hand upgrades)
- `InventoryManager` events (item acquisition, inventory changes)
- `PlayerMovementManager` events (platform landings)

## üìä Analytics & Learning

### Player Behavior Tracking

The system tracks:
- **Exploration patterns** (platform navigation efficiency)
- **Combat performance** (damage taken/avoided, enemy defeat rates)
- **Resource management** (gem spending patterns, inventory usage)
- **Risk assessment** (health maintenance, safety vs efficiency)

### Adaptive Responses

Based on behavior, the AI will:
- Provide more tactical advice for aggressive players
- Offer encouragement for cautious players  
- Suggest optimizations for efficient players
- Give exploration hints for thorough players

## üé≠ Message Types & Emotions

### Message Types
- **Normal**: Standard observations
- **Warning**: Caution alerts
- **Urgent**: Critical situations
- **Analysis**: Behavioral commentary
- **Discovery**: New findings
- **System**: Technical notifications

### Emotion Types
- **Normal**: Default white text
- **Happy**: Green text (success, achievements)
- **Warning**: Yellow text (caution)
- **Danger**: Red text (critical situations)
- **Analytical**: Cyan text (analysis mode)
- **Excited**: Magenta text (discoveries, powerups)

## üî¨ Advanced Features

### Memory System

The AI remembers:
- Player behavioral patterns
- Past events and references them
- Performance metrics over time
- Strategic decisions and their outcomes

### Contextual Item Analysis

When hovering over items, the AI provides:
- Item classification and properties
- Strategic usage suggestions
- Inventory space warnings
- Compatibility with current loadout

### Health Monitoring

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No messages appearing**
   - Check UI references are assigned
   - Verify CognitiveFeedManagerEnhanced is active
   - Check console for initialization errors

2. **Typewriter not working**
   - Verify TextMeshProUGUI component is assigned
   - Check if coroutines are being interrupted
   - Ensure Canvas Groups have proper alpha settings

3. **Item hover not working**
   - Verify UnifiedSlot has cognitive integration
   - Check CognitiveEvents are properly invoked
   - Ensure persistent message UI is configured

4. **Audio not playing**
   - Verify GameSounds.PlayCognitiveFeedWord exists
   - Check AudioSource component is created
   - Ensure audio system is initialized

### Debug Features

Enable verbose logging by:
- Setting debug flags in the inspector
- Checking console for cognitive events
- Using the built-in analytics debug methods

## üöÄ Customization

### Adding New Events

1. Add new event delegates to `CognitiveEvents.cs`
2. Create message generation methods in `CognitiveFeedManagerEnhanced.cs`
3. Add event handlers and subscribe in the manager
4. Trigger events from relevant game systems

### Personality Customization

Adjust personality traits:
- **Curiosity**: How often it comments on discoveries
- **Analytical**: Frequency of behavioral analysis
- **Sarcasm**: Personality flavor in responses
- **Support**: How encouraging vs critical it is
- **Urgency**: Response speed to dangerous situations

### Message Pool Expansion

Add more message variations in the generation methods to prevent repetition and increase immersion.

## üéØ Performance Notes
