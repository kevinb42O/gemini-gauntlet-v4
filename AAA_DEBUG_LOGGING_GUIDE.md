# 🔍 GROUNDING DEBUG SYSTEM - ACTIVATED

## 📊 Debug Logs Added

I've added comprehensive debug logging to track EXACTLY what's happening with your grounding system.

### What Gets Logged:

#### Every 30 Frames (to avoid spam):
```
[GROUNDING DEBUG] Frame:1234
  controller.isGrounded: True/False
  SphereCast Hit: True/False
  Cast Origin: (x, y, z) - Where the raycast starts
  Cast Distance: 70.0 - How far down it checks
  Cast Radius: 45.0 - Size of the sphere
  Capsule Bottom Y: 0.0 - Actual bottom of character
  Transform Pos Y: 150.0 - Center of character
  Hit Distance: 25.5 - Distance to ground from origin
  Hit Point Y: 124.5 - Actual Y position of ground
  Ground Normal: (0.0, 0.87, 0.5) - Surface angle
  Slope Angle: 30.2° - Calculated slope
  Current Velocity: (500, -10, 200)
  Controller Velocity: (495, -9.8, 198)
```

#### When Ground Contact Changes:
```
[GROUNDING] ⚠️ Player LOST GROUND | Velocity.y: -15.2 | SlopeAngle: 35.0°
[GROUNDING] ✅ Player GAINED GROUND | Velocity.y: 0.0
```

#### When Slope Descent Activates:
```
[SLOPE DESCENT] Angle:35.2° | Normalized:0.67 | Pull:6750.0 | Direction:(0, -0.5, 0.87)
```

#### Critical Errors:
```
[GROUNDING] ❌ MISMATCH! controller.isGrounded=TRUE but SphereCast found NO GROUND!
  This means CharacterController thinks you're grounded but raycast can't find the ground!
  Possible causes: Step Offset too small, ground mask wrong, or detection range too small
```

```
[SLOPE] No descent force applied! Angle:35.2° (needs >5° and <=50°)
```

## 🎮 How to Test:

1. **Play the game**
2. **Walk down a slope** while watching the Console
3. **Copy ALL the logs** and paste them here
4. Or **take screenshots** of the Console window

---

## 🔍 What I'm Looking For:

### Key Diagnostics:

1. **Is SphereCast hitting ground?**
   - `SphereCast Hit: False` = Ground detection failing

2. **Is controller.isGrounded working?**
   - `controller.isGrounded: False` = CharacterController losing contact

3. **Are they mismatched?**
   - `controller.isGrounded=TRUE but SphereCast=FALSE` = Step Offset too small
   - `controller.isGrounded=FALSE but SphereCast=TRUE` = Something else blocking grounding

4. **What's the slope angle?**
   - `Slope Angle: 0°` on a slope = Ground normal detection broken
   - `Slope Angle: 35°` but no descent force = Logic bug

5. **Where is the cast origin?**
   - `Cast Origin Y` should be ~50 units above ground
   - If it's 200+ units, calculation is wrong

6. **Is descent force applying?**
   - Should see `[SLOPE DESCENT]` logs when on slopes >5°
   - If not, tells us why

## 📋 Testing Checklist:

Please test these scenarios and send me the logs:

### Test 1: Flat Ground
- [ ] Walk on flat ground for 3 seconds
- [ ] Check: `controller.isGrounded: True`
- [ ] Check: `SphereCast Hit: True`
- [ ] Check: `Slope Angle: 0-2°`

### Test 2: Gentle Slope (10-20°)
- [ ] Walk down gentle slope
- [ ] Check: `controller.isGrounded: True` or `False`?
- [ ] Check: `SphereCast Hit: True` or `False`?
- [ ] Check: `Slope Angle` value
- [ ] Check: Does `[SLOPE DESCENT]` log appear?

### Test 3: Steep Slope (30-45°)
- [ ] Walk down steep slope
- [ ] Check: Do you see "⚠️ Player LOST GROUND" warnings?
- [ ] Check: `Slope Angle` value
- [ ] Check: `Velocity.y` value when losing ground

### Test 4: Standing Still on Slope
- [ ] Stand still on a slope
- [ ] Check: `controller.isGrounded: True` or `False`?
- [ ] Check: `Slope Angle` detection

## 🎯 Quick Diagnosis Guide:

### If you see:
```
SphereCast Hit: False
controller.isGrounded: False
```
**Problem:** Can't detect ground at all → Ground Check Distance or Layer Mask issue

### If you see:
```
SphereCast Hit: True
controller.isGrounded: False
Slope Angle: 35°
```
**Problem:** Detecting ground but not staying attached → **Step Offset too small!**

### If you see:
```
SphereCast Hit: True
controller.isGrounded: True
Slope Angle: 0°
```
**Problem:** Ground detection working but slope angle is wrong → Normal calculation issue

### If you see:
```
[SLOPE] No descent force applied! Angle:35°
```
**Problem:** Slope detected but force not applying → MaxSlopeAngle or logic error

### If you see:
```
⚠️ Player LOST GROUND every few frames
```
**Problem:** Constantly losing/regaining ground → **Step Offset definitely too small!**

## 💡 Expected CORRECT Output:

When walking down a 30° slope, you should see:

```
[GROUNDING DEBUG] Frame:1234
  controller.isGrounded: True  ✅
  SphereCast Hit: True  ✅
  Cast Origin: (10, 50, 10)  ✅ (~50 above ground)
  Cast Distance: 70.0  ✅
  Slope Angle: 30.2°  ✅
  
[SLOPE DESCENT] Angle:30.2° | Normalized:0.56 | Pull:5600.0  ✅

NO "LOST GROUND" warnings  ✅
```

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Play the game** on a slope
2. **Copy the Console output** (especially any errors/warnings)
3. **Paste them here** and I'll tell you EXACTLY what's wrong
4. Or **tell me what you see** (colors, key values)

The logs will reveal the exact problem immediately!
