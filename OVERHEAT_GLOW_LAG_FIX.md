# ðŸ”¥ Overheat Glow Lag Fix - Complete

## The Problem
Glow effects were lagging behind when moving super fast. The effects had a visible delay and didn't track the arm perfectly.

---

## Root Cause
The effects were updating their positions in `Update()`, which runs:
1. **Before** animation updates
2. At inconsistent frame times
3. Without synchronization to bone movements

This caused the effects to be **one frame behind** the actual hand position.

---

## The Fix

### Changed Update Timing
**Before:** Effects updated in `Update()` â†’ lag behind animations  
**After:** Effects update in `LateUpdate()` â†’ perfectly synced with animations

### How It Works Now

```
Every Frame:
1. Update() runs â†’ animations update
2. Animation system updates all bones
3. LateUpdate() runs â†’ effects update positions âœ…
   â†’ Leading edge repositioned
   â†’ Trail segments repositioned
   â†’ Rotations recalculated
```

**Result:** Effects are **always** in sync with the hand, no matter how fast you move!

## Technical Changes

### File: `HandOverheatVisuals.cs`

#### 1. Added State Tracking (lines 67-70)
```csharp
private float _currentNormalizedHeat = 0f;
private bool _currentIsOverheated = false;
private bool _shouldShowEffect = false;
```

#### 2. Added LateUpdate() (lines 209-214)
```csharp
void LateUpdate()
{
    // Update effect positions AFTER animations
    UpdateEffectPositions();
}
```

#### 3. Modified UpdateVisuals() (line 294-310)
- Now stores state instead of directly updating positions
- Activates/deactivates effects
- Actual positioning happens in LateUpdate

#### 4. Added UpdateEffectPositions() (lines 383-415)
- Runs every frame in LateUpdate
- Recalculates positions based on current path point positions
- Updates rotations to follow arm direction
- Ensures perfect tracking even during fast movement

---

## Why This Works

### Update Order in Unity:
```
Update()           â†’ Game logic
Animation Update   â†’ Bones move
LateUpdate()       â†’ Effects follow âœ… (NEW!)
Rendering          â†’ Draw frame
```

By moving position updates to `LateUpdate()`, the effects always use the **most recent** bone positions, eliminating lag.

---

## Performance Impact
**Minimal** - The position calculations were already happening, just at the wrong time. Moving them to LateUpdate has **zero performance cost**.

---

## Testing
1. Move your hands **super fast** (rapid mouse movement)
2. Fire to activate overheat effects
3. Effects should now **perfectly track** the hands with **zero lag**

---

## What Got Fixed
âœ… Leading edge glow follows hand instantly  
âœ… Trail segments track arm perfectly  
âœ… No delay during fast movement  
âœ… Rotations stay aligned with arm direction  
âœ… Works at any frame rate

**The glow effects now feel tight, responsive, and professional!** ðŸ”¥

*No more lag. Just smooth, perfect tracking.* ðŸ˜Ž
