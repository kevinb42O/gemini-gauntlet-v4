# 🔧 Chest Humming Sound Fix

## Problem
After implementing the speaker cube system, chest humming sounds stopped working with the error:
```
[ChestSoundManager] ❌ SoundEventsManager.Events is NULL
[ChestSoundManager] ❌ Fallback AudioSource is NULL!
[ChestSoundManager] ❌ NO AUDIO CLIP AVAILABLE!
```

## Root Cause
**Scene Initialization Order Issue**

1. `ChestController.Awake()` was calling `SetChestState(ChestState.Closed)` immediately
2. This triggered `chestSoundManager.StartChestHumming()` in `Awake()`
3. At this point, `SoundEventsManager.Instance` was **NULL** because:
   - The sound system hadn't initialized yet
   - The speaker cube system may have affected initialization order
   - `Awake()` is too early to access singleton managers

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Delayed Chest Humming Start** (`ChestController.cs`)
- **Changed**: Moved humming initialization from `Awake()` to `Start()`
- **Why**: `Start()` runs after all `Awake()` calls, ensuring `SoundEventsManager` is initialized
- **Lines Modified**: 150-167, 186-203

### 2. **Retry Mechanism** (`ChestSoundManager.cs`)
- **Added**: Automatic retry system that attempts to start humming every 0.5 seconds
- **Max Retries**: 5 attempts (2.5 seconds total)
- **Fallback**: Uses direct `AudioSource` if advanced system fails
- **Lines Modified**: 38-43, 63-86, 104-126

### 3. **Better Error Detection** (`ChestSoundManager.cs`)
- **Added**: Check for both `SoundEventsManager.Instance` AND `Events`
- **Why**: Distinguishes between "not initialized yet" vs "database not assigned"
- **Lines Modified**: 88-99

## How It Works Now

```
1. ChestController.Awake()
   └─> Sets currentState = Closed (no sound yet)
   
2. SoundEventsManager.Awake()
   └─> Initializes singleton
   
3. ChestController.Start()
   └─> Calls chestSoundManager.StartChestHumming()
       └─> Tries advanced system
           ├─> SUCCESS: Plays humming sound ✅
           └─> FAIL: Enables retry mechanism
   
4. ChestSoundManager.Update() [if retry enabled]
   └─> Retries every 0.5s (max 5 times)
       └─> Eventually succeeds or uses fallback
```

## Testing
1. **Manual Chests**: Should start humming ~0.5s after scene loads
2. **Spawned Chests**: Should start humming when they reach `Closed` state
3. **Fallback**: If advanced system fails, direct `AudioSource` plays the sound

## Files Modified
- ✅ `Assets/scripts/ChestSoundManager.cs`
- ✅ `Assets/scripts/ChestController.cs`

## Additional Fix: Distance-Based Cleanup for Fallback Audio

### Problem #2
After the initial fix, chests using fallback audio never stopped humming regardless of distance.

### Root Cause
- The **advanced system** has automatic distance-based cleanup via `SpatialAudioManager`
- The **fallback AudioSource** had no distance checking - it played forever once started
- The retry mechanism could restart sounds unintentionally

### Solution
1. **Added distance checking** for fallback audio in `Update()` (lines 94-118)
2. **Disabled retry on stop** to prevent unwanted restarts (lines 264-267)
3. **Fixed retry logic** to only try during initial startup (line 66)

### How Distance Cleanup Works
```
Fallback Audio:
- Checks distance every frame in Update()
- Stops if player > maxAudibleDistance (20m default)
- Uses Camera.main.transform as player position

Advanced Audio:
- Handled automatically by SpatialAudioManager
- No manual checking needed
```

## Notes
- The speaker cube system (`SpeakerMusicManager`) has the same pattern and may benefit from similar fixes
- This fix ensures chest sounds work regardless of scene initialization order
- Fallback system now has proper distance-based cleanup matching the advanced system
- Retry mechanism only runs during initial startup, not during gameplay
