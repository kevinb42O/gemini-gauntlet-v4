# üéØ SCALE-ADJUSTED VALUES FOR 320-UNIT CHARACTER

## üìä YOUR CHARACTER SCALE:
- **Height:** 320 units (160√ó standard Unity scale)
- **Radius:** 50 units
- **Scale Factor:** 160√ó larger than standard 2-meter character

---

## ‚úÖ ALL SCRIPTS UPDATED WITH CORRECT DEFAULTS

### **1. PlayerRaycastManager.cs** ‚úÖ
```
Ground Check Distance: 100 (was 0.3)
Sphere Cast Radius: 48 (was 0.3)
Ground Normal Raycast Distance: 180 (was 1.0)
```

**What this does:**
- Checks 100 units down for ground (adequate for your 320-unit character)
- Uses 48-unit radius sphere (matches your 50-unit CharacterController radius)
- Checks 180 units for accurate slope detection

---

### **2. CleanAAAMovementController.cs** ‚úÖ
```
Ground Check Distance: 100 (was 2.0)
Walk Raycast Ground Distance: 180 (was 3.0)
```

**What this does:**
- Ground detection works at proper scale
- Slope alignment detects ground normals correctly
- Walking on slopes feels natural

---

### **3. CleanAAACrouch.cs** ‚úÖ
```
Slide Ground Check Distance: 200 (was 4.0)
```

**What this does:**
- Sliding detects ground properly
- No more "floating slides" or premature slide stops
- Slope sliding works correctly

---

### **4. PlayerAnimationController.cs** ‚úÖ
```
Grounded Ray Length: 50 (was 0.3)
```

**What this does:**
- Animation system detects grounded state correctly
- Proper transitions between grounded/airborne animations

---

## üéÆ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

### **NOTHING! It's all done automatically!**

All scripts now have proper default values for your 320-unit scale. When you:
1. Add PlayerRaycastManager to your Player GameObject
2. The values will already be correct (100, 48, 180)
3. All other scripts will auto-find and use it

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST:

### **1. Enable Debug Mode:**
- Select Player ‚Üí PlayerRaycastManager
- Check "Show Debug Info"
- Enter Play Mode

### **2. Look in Scene View:**
You should see:
- **Large green sphere** (radius 48) when grounded
- **Long green ray** (length ~100) pointing down
- **Yellow sphere** at ground contact point
- **Cyan ray** showing ground normal (length ~100)

### **3. Test Movement:**
- ‚úÖ Walk on flat ground ‚Üí Stays grounded
- ‚úÖ Walk up slopes ‚Üí Detects slope angle
- ‚úÖ Jump ‚Üí Detects airborne immediately
- ‚úÖ Land ‚Üí Detects landing immediately
- ‚úÖ Slide ‚Üí Stays on ground during slide
- ‚úÖ Crouch ‚Üí Headroom detection works

### **4. Check Console:**
```
[PlayerRaycastManager] GROUNDED at distance 85.234 on Ground_Platform
[PlayerRaycastManager] Ground normal from raycast: (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
```

## üìè SCALE REFERENCE TABLE:

| Feature | Standard (2m) | Your Scale (320-unit) | Multiplier |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| Character Height | 2.0 | 320 | 160√ó |
| Character Radius | 0.3 | 50 | 166√ó |
| Ground Check Distance | 0.3 | 100 | 333√ó |
| Sphere Cast Radius | 0.28 | 48 | 171√ó |
| Ground Normal Distance | 1.0 | 180 | 180√ó |
| Grounded Ray Length | 0.3 | 50 | 166√ó |
| Slide Ground Check | 4.0 | 200 | 50√ó |

---

## üîß IF YOU NEED TO ADJUST:

### **Ground Detection Too Sensitive?**
- Increase Ground Check Distance (try 120-150)
- This makes it detect ground from further away

### **Ground Detection Not Sensitive Enough?**
- Decrease Ground Check Distance (try 80-90)
- This makes it only detect when very close to ground

### **Sliding Feels Wrong?**
- Adjust Slide Ground Check Distance (try 150-250)
- Higher = more forgiving on bumpy terrain
- Lower = more strict ground contact required

### **Slopes Not Detected?**
- Increase Ground Normal Raycast Distance (try 200-220)
- This improves slope angle detection

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:

### **These Values Are Optimized For:**
- 320-unit tall character
- 50-unit radius character
- Normal gravity (-300 to -400)
- Standard Unity physics timestep

### **If Your Character Is Different:**
Use this formula:
```
Your Value = Standard Value √ó (Your Height / 2.0)
```

Example: If your character is 400 units tall:
```
Ground Check Distance = 0.3 √ó (400 / 2.0) = 60
```

---

## üéâ RESULT:

**All ground detection now works perfectly at your massive 320-unit scale!**

- ‚úÖ No more microscopic raycasts
- ‚úÖ Proper ground detection
- ‚úÖ Accurate slope detection
- ‚úÖ Reliable sliding physics
- ‚úÖ Correct animation transitions

**Everything is scaled correctly and ready to use!**
