# üîä Enemy Companion Stream Sound Fix

## Problem
The EnemyCompanion's **shotgun sound plays perfectly**, but the **stream/beam sound never plays** even though everything is assigned correctly in the Inspector.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the **performance optimization system** in `EnemyCompanionBehavior`:

1. When an enemy is far from the player, `SetComponentsActive(false)` is called to save performance
2. This disables **ALL child GameObjects**, including the `StreamAudio` GameObject that contains the `_streamAudioSource`
3. When the enemy reactivates, the child GameObject is re-enabled, but the `_streamAudioSource` reference in `CompanionAudio` becomes **stale/null**
4. `PlayStreamSound()` checks if `_streamAudioSource == null` and returns early without playing any sound
5. **Shotgun worked** because it uses the main `_audioSource` on the parent GameObject, which doesn't get destroyed

## The Fix
Modified `CompanionAudio.cs` to **automatically reinitialize** audio sources if they become null:

### Changes Made:

1. **`PlayShotgunSound()`** - Added null check and reinitialize
2. **`PlayStreamSound()`** - Added null check and reinitialize  
3. **`SetupAudioSources()`** - Made it reusable by checking for existing StreamAudio child before creating a new one

### How It Works:
- When `PlayStreamSound()` is called and `_streamAudioSource` is null, it calls `SetupAudioSources()`
- `SetupAudioSources()` now checks if "StreamAudio" child already exists and reuses it
- If it doesn't exist, it creates a new one
- This ensures audio always works, even after deactivation/reactivation cycles

## Testing
1. Place an EnemyCompanion far from the player (beyond activation radius)
2. Wait for it to deactivate (all systems disabled for performance)
3. Move close to trigger reactivation
4. The enemy should now play **both shotgun AND stream sounds** correctly

## Debug Logs Added
The fix includes helpful debug logs:
- `"‚ö†Ô∏è Stream audio source is null - attempting to reinitialize..."`
- `"‚úÖ Stream sound started via SoundEvents!"`
- `"Found existing StreamAudio - reusing it"`
- `"Audio system initialized successfully (created new StreamAudio)"`

Watch the console to confirm the fix is working!
