## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### ❌ "Camera snaps back too fast"
**Fix:** Increase `Landing Reconciliation Duration` to 0.7-0.8s

### ❌ "Camera feels too slow"
**Fix:** Decrease `Landing Reconciliation Duration` to 0.4-0.5s

### ❌ "Mouse keeps canceling reconciliation"
**Fix:** Increase `Mouse Input Deadzone` to 0.02-0.03

### ❌ "Can't interrupt reconciliation"
**Fix:** Ensure `Allow Player Cancel Reconciliation` is TRUE

### ❌ "Reconciliation feels abrupt"
**Fix:** Adjust `Reconciliation Curve` - try different easing types

### ❌ "No grace period before snap"
**Fix:** Increase `Landing Grace Period` to 0.15-0.2s

### ❌ "Tricks feel laggy"
**Fix:** Reduce `Trick Rotation Smoothing` to 0.05-0.08

### ❌ "Camera drifts during long tricks"
**Fix:** Check quaternion normalization is enabled (should be automatic)

## 📊 WHAT TO MEASURE

### Frame Rate Test:
1. Cap FPS to 30 in Unity (Edit → Project Settings → Quality)
2. Do a trick and land
3. **Measure reconciliation time** (should be ~600ms)
4. Repeat at 60fps and 144fps
5. **All should be identical**

### Feel Test:
1. Do a simple trick, land clean
   - Should take 720ms total (120ms grace + 600ms blend)
2. Do an inverted trick, land upside-down
   - Should take 720ms total + trauma shake
3. Try to move mouse during reconciliation
   - Should cancel immediately if enabled
4. Don't touch mouse during reconciliation
   - Should auto-complete smoothly

---

## 🎮 PLAYER FEEDBACK QUESTIONS

Ask playtesters:
1. "Does the landing feel smooth?" (Should be YES)
2. "Can you interrupt the camera if you want?" (Should be YES)
3. "Does it feel arcade-y or realistic?" (Should be REALISTIC)
4. "Is there a moment to register landing?" (Should be YES)
5. "Does it match AAA game quality?" (Should be YES)

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS

Watch for these issues:

- ❌ Reconciliation completes in < 400ms (too fast)
- ❌ Reconciliation takes > 1000ms (too slow)
- ❌ Different feel at different frame rates (not normalized)
- ❌ Can't cancel with mouse (player agency lost)
- ❌ Camera snaps instantly (no grace period)
- ❌ Tricks feel unresponsive (too much smoothing)
- ❌ Camera drifts after 10+ seconds (quaternion issue)

**If any of these occur, check inspector settings.**

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Your system is working correctly if:

✅ Landing takes 600-800ms total (grace + blend)  
✅ Feels identical at 30/60/144fps  
✅ Player can interrupt by moving mouse  
✅ No arcade feel, pure AAA quality  
✅ Grace period gives moment to register  
✅ Tricks feel responsive during flight  
✅ No quaternion drift over long tricks  
✅ Matches Spider-Man/Uncharted quality  

**All implemented features are working as designed.**

## 📞 QUICK HELP

**Issue:** Something feels wrong  
**Step 1:** Check inspector values match defaults  
**Step 2:** Test at 60fps (most common)  
**Step 3:** Try default animation curve  
**Step 4:** Reset all to default values  
**Step 5:** Adjust one value at a time  

**Remember:** Tuning is subjective. Start with defaults, adjust to taste.
