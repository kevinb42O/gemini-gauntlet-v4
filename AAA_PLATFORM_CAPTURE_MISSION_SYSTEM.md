# AAA Platform Capture Mission System
## "King of the Hill" Capture Point Implementation

---

## üéØ Overview

A complete **King of the Hill** mission system where players must defend a Central Tower on a platform for a specified duration to capture it. Successfully capturing a platform rewards the player with gems and XP while clearing all enemies.

---

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Mechanics
- **Central Tower**: Invulnerable aesthetic tower that defines the capture zone
- **Capture Radius**: Configurable radius around Central Tower (default: 1500 units)
- **Progress System**: Slider fills while player is in radius, drains when outside
- **Punishment**: Progress drains at same rate it fills when player leaves radius
- **Death Penalty**: Progress resets to 0 if player dies
- **Duration**: Configurable capture time (default: 120 seconds)

### Mission Complete Sequence
When platform is captured:
1. ‚úÖ All **SkullEnemy** instances destroyed
2. ‚úÖ All **Gem** instances destroyed (decouple from towers)
3. ‚úÖ All **TowerController** instances killed (sink animation)
4. ‚úÖ Continuous tower spawning disabled
5. ‚úÖ Central Tower spawns reward gems in 360¬∞ radius
6. ‚úÖ Player receives XP grant (+2500 XP) *(ready for integration)*

### Tower Spawn Cap
- **Max Simultaneous Towers**: 15 (configurable)
- **Initial Spawn**: 3 towers (uses existing min/max settings)
- **Continuous Spawning**: Enabled by default, capped at 15 towers
- Towers respawn when killed until cap is reached

---

## üìÅ New Scripts Created

### 1. **CentralTower.cs**
The invulnerable capture point tower.

**Key Features:**
- Defines capture radius (visible in Scene view as cyan wireframe)
- Cannot be destroyed (removes TowerController if present)
- Spawns reward gems in 360¬∞ pattern on capture
- Visual feedback materials (capturing/captured states)
- Configurable gem spawn settings

**Inspector Fields:**
```csharp
[Header("Capture Radius")]
public float captureRadius = 1500f;

[Header("Gem Spawning on Capture")]
public GameObject gemPrefab;
public int gemsToSpawn = 12;
public float gemSpawnRadius = 500f;
public float gemSpawnHeight = 300f;

[Header("Visual Feedback")]
public Material capturingMaterial;
public Material capturedMaterial;
```

---

### 2. **PlatformCaptureSystem.cs**
Main mission logic controller.

**Key Features:**
- Tracks capture progress (0 to captureDuration)
- Monitors player position relative to capture radius
- Handles progress fill/drain mechanics
- Triggers mission complete sequence
- Integrates with TowerSpawner, PlatformTrigger, and UI

**Inspector Fields:**
```csharp
[Header("References")]
public CentralTower centralTower;
public PlatformTrigger platformTrigger;
public TowerSpawner towerSpawner;
public PlatformCaptureUI progressUI;

[Header("Audio & VFX")]
public SoundEvents soundEvents;
public GameObject captureCompleteParticles;

[Header("Capture Settings")]
public float captureDuration = 120f;

[Header("Mission State")]
public bool missionActive = false;
public bool platformCaptured = false;
```

**Public Methods:**
- `ActivateMission()` - Start the capture mission
- `ResetCaptureProgress()` - Reset progress to 0
- `OnPlayerDeath()` - Call when player dies to reset progress

---

### 3. **CaptureProgressUI.cs** *(Enhanced)*
Worldspace UI slider controller.

**Key Features:**
- Auto-creates UI if not assigned
- Shows/hides based on player platform presence
- Real-time progress percentage and time remaining
- Color gradient (cyan ‚Üí green) as progress increases
- Completion flash effect

**New Methods Added:**
- `Show()` - Display the UI
- `Hide()` - Hide the UI
- `IsVisible()` - Check if UI is visible

---

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Central Tower GameObject
1. Create a **Cube** GameObject on your platform
2. Name it `CentralTower`
3. Add **CentralTower.cs** component
4. Configure in Inspector:
   - Set `Capture Radius` (e.g., 1500)
   - Assign `Gem Prefab` (your collectible gem)
   - Set `Gems To Spawn` (e.g., 12)
   - Set `Gem Spawn Radius` (e.g., 500)
   - *(Optional)* Assign visual feedback materials

### Step 2: Setup Platform Capture System
1. Select your **Platform** GameObject (the one with TowerSpawner)
2. Add **PlatformCaptureSystem.cs** component
3. Configure in Inspector:
   - **Central Tower**: Drag your CentralTower GameObject
   - **Platform Trigger**: Drag your PlatformTrigger
   - **Tower Spawner**: Drag your TowerSpawner
   - **Progress UI**: Leave empty (auto-creates) or assign custom UI
   - **Capture Duration**: Set to 120 (2 minutes)
4. Check `Mission Active` to enable the mission

### Step 3: Configure Tower Spawner
1. Select your **TowerSpawner** component
2. Enable **Continuous Spawning**: ‚úÖ Check the box
3. Set **Max Simultaneous Towers**: 15
4. Set **Min Towers To Spawn**: 3
5. Set **Max Towers To Spawn**: 3

### Step 4: Setup UI (Optional)
If you want to use your own worldspace canvas:
1. Create a **CaptureProgressUI** GameObject
2. Add **CaptureProgressUI.cs** component
3. Assign your custom UI elements in Inspector
4. Parent it to your worldspace canvas
5. Drag this GameObject to PlatformCaptureSystem's `Progress UI` field

## üéÆ How It Works

### Player Flow
1. **Player enters platform** ‚Üí UI slider appears (inactive)
2. **Player enters Central Tower radius** ‚Üí Slider starts filling
3. **Player leaves radius** ‚Üí Slider drains at same rate
4. **Player leaves platform** ‚Üí Progress resets to 0, UI hides
5. **Player dies** ‚Üí Progress resets to 0
6. **Capture completes (120s)** ‚Üí Mission success sequence triggers

### Mission Success Sequence
```
1. Central Tower visual feedback (captured material)
2. UI shows "CAPTURE COMPLETE!"
3. Wait 0.5s
4. Destroy all SkullEnemy instances
5. Destroy all Gem instances
6. Wait 0.3s
7. Kill all TowerController instances (sink animation)
8. Disable continuous tower spawning
9. Wait 1s
10. Central Tower spawns reward gems in 360¬∞ pattern
11. Grant XP to player (+2500)
```

---

## üé® Visual Feedback

### In Scene View
- **Cyan Wireframe Sphere**: Capture radius around Central Tower
- **Yellow Wireframe Sphere**: Gem spawn radius
- **Green Line**: Connection from PlatformCaptureSystem to Central Tower

### In Game
- **UI Slider**: Fills cyan ‚Üí green as progress increases
- **Progress Text**: Shows percentage and time remaining
- **Status Text**: "CAPTURING..." / "CAPTURE COMPLETE!" / "CAPTURE INTERRUPTED!"
- **Completion Flash**: Green flash effect on success

---

## üîå Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **TowerSpawner**: Enhanced with max tower cap (15)
- **TowerController**: Death sequence triggered on capture
- **PlatformTrigger**: Used to detect player on platform
- **SkullEnemy**: Destroyed on capture
- **Gem**: Destroyed on capture (decouples from towers)

### XP System Integration (Ready)
Uncomment this line in `PlatformCaptureSystem.cs` line 238:
```csharp
GeminiGauntlet.Progression.XPHooks.OnPlatformCaptured(2500);
```

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues

**UI doesn't appear:**
- Check `Mission Active` is enabled on PlatformCaptureSystem
- Verify player has "Player" tag
- Check PlatformTrigger is working (player on platform)

**Progress doesn't fill:**
- Verify player is within Central Tower's capture radius (cyan sphere in Scene view)
- Check Central Tower reference is assigned
- Ensure player transform is being found

**Towers keep spawning infinitely:**
- Check `Max Simultaneous Towers` is set to 15
- Verify `Enable Continuous Spawning` is checked
- Look for errors in Console

**Gems don't spawn on capture:**
- Assign `Gem Prefab` on Central Tower
- Check gem prefab has Gem.cs component
- Verify gem spawn settings are reasonable

---

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **Efficient**: Event-driven architecture, no continuous polling
- **Optimized**: Uses HashSets and Dictionaries for fast lookups
- **Clean**: Proper cleanup in OnDestroy methods
- **Safe**: Null checks throughout, no memory leaks

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Multiple capture points per platform
- Contested capture (enemies can reverse progress)
- Difficulty scaling (more enemies as capture progresses)
- Audio cues (capture progress milestones)
- Particle effects for capture radius boundary
- Leaderboard integration (fastest capture times)
- Multiplayer support (team captures)
