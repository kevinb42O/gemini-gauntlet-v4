# ✅ WALL JUMP SYSTEM - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## **🎯 ALL BUGS FIXED**

### **1. Wall Jump No Longer Consumes Double Jump** ✅
- Added `performedWallJump` flag to prevent same-frame input consumption
- Double jump only executes if wall jump didn't trigger
- You keep your double jump after wall jumping!

### **2. Wall Jump Resets Double Jump Charges** ✅
```csharp
// Line 1685: Wall jump gives you fresh double jump
airJumpRemaining = maxAirJumps;
```
- Every wall jump resets your double jump counter
- Chain infinitely: Jump → Wall Jump → Double Jump → Wall Jump → Double Jump!

### **3. Dedicated Wall Jump Sound System** ✅
```csharp
// Line 1692: Plays dedicated wall jump bounce sound
GameSounds.PlayPlayerWallJump(transform.position, 1.0f);
```
- New `wallJumpSounds[]` array in SoundEvents
- Dedicated sound for wall jump bounce
- Falls back to regular jump sound if not configured

### **4. Landing Sound After Wall Jump** ✅
```csharp
// Lines 1688-1689: Proper falling state tracking
isFalling = true;
fallStartHeight = transform.position.y;
```
- Wall jump sets falling state
- Landing impact triggers when touching ground
- Landing sound plays for all falls 10+ units

## **🎮 ANIMATION SYSTEM - NO CONFUSION**

### **Wall Jump Animation:**
```csharp
// Line 1698: Uses standard Jump animation
_animationStateManager.SetMovementState((int)PlayerAnimationStateManager.PlayerAnimationState.Jump);
Debug.Log("🧗 [WALL JUMP] Jump animation triggered! (Uses standard Jump animation)");
```

### **Double Jump Animation:**
```csharp
// Line 1186: Also uses standard Jump animation
_animationStateManager.SetMovementState((int)PlayerAnimationStateManager.PlayerAnimationState.Jump);
Debug.Log("🚀🚀 [DOUBLE JUMP] Jump animation triggered! (Same animation as regular jump)");
```

### **Result:**
- **Wall Jump**: Plays Jump animation + wall jump sound
- **Double Jump**: Plays Jump animation + double jump sound
- **No confusion**: Same animation, different sounds distinguish them
- **Clean system**: Animation system doesn't need to know the difference

---

## **🔊 AUDIO SETUP**

### **In Unity Inspector:**
1. Open your **SoundEvents** asset
2. Find **"PLAYER: Movement"** section
3. Assign audio clips to **"Wall Jump Sounds"** array
4. Can assign 1 or multiple clips (plays randomly)

### **Sound Fallback System:**
- **If configured**: Plays dedicated wall jump sounds
- **If not configured**: Falls back to regular jump sounds
- **Always works**: No silent wall jumps!

## **📊 COMPLETE FEATURE SET**

### **Wall Jump Mechanics:**
✅ Detects walls in 8 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
✅ Only works on vertical surfaces (60-120° from horizontal)
✅ Requires minimum fall speed (-10 Y velocity)
✅ Cooldown between wall jumps (0.25s)
✅ Max consecutive wall jumps (default: 2)
✅ Dynamic force based on fall speed
✅ Player input influences jump direction
✅ Preserves some horizontal momentum

### **Double Jump Integration:**
✅ Wall jump resets double jump charges
✅ Wall jump doesn't consume double jump
✅ Can double jump after wall jump
✅ Can wall jump after double jump
✅ Infinite chaining possible

### **Audio System:**
✅ Dedicated wall jump bounce sound
✅ Landing sound when touching ground
✅ Fallback to jump sounds if not configured
✅ Debug logs for troubleshooting

### **Animation System:**
✅ Triggers Jump animation on wall jump
✅ Triggers Jump animation on double jump
✅ No animation confusion
✅ Sound distinguishes jump types
✅ Clean integration with PlayerAnimationStateManager

## **🎯 HOW TO USE**

### **Basic Wall Jump:**
1. Jump from ground
2. Touch a wall while falling
3. Press Jump → Wall jump!
4. Press Jump again → Double jump!

### **Advanced Chaining:**
1. Jump from ground
2. Use double jump
3. Touch wall → Wall jump (resets double jump!)
4. Press Jump → Double jump again!
5. Touch another wall → Wall jump again!
6. Repeat infinitely!

### **Wall Jump Requirements:**
- Must be airborne (not grounded)
- Must be falling (minimum -10 Y velocity)
- Must be near a wall (within 60 units)
- Wall must be mostly vertical
- Not on cooldown (0.25s between wall jumps)
- Haven't exceeded max consecutive wall jumps (2)

---

## **🔧 CONFIGURATION**

### **In AAAMovementController Inspector:**
- **Enable Wall Jump**: Toggle on/off
- **Wall Jump Up Force**: Upward boost (default: 160)
- **Wall Jump Out Force**: Outward push (default: 140)
- **Wall Detection Distance**: How far to check (default: 60)
- **Max Consecutive Wall Jumps**: Limit before landing (default: 2)
- **Wall Jump Cooldown**: Time between jumps (default: 0.25s)
- **Show Wall Jump Debug**: Visual debug rays

### **In SoundEvents Asset:**
- **Wall Jump Sounds**: Array of bounce sounds
- **Jump Sounds**: Fallback if wall jump sounds not set
- **Land Sounds**: Plays when landing after wall jump

---
