# üéØ QUICK FIX: Freestyle Yaw Drift (-215¬∞ Bug)

## The Problem
Standing still + jump = camera rotates 144¬∞ to -215¬∞ yaw ‚ùå

## The Cause
`HandleLookInput()` accumulated mouse drift during freestyle mode, but freestyle ignored it. On landing, reconciliation used the corrupted `currentLook.x` value.

## The Fix
```csharp
private void HandleLookInput()
{
    // NEW: Sync currentLook with freestyleRotation during freestyle
    if (isFreestyleModeActive || isReconciling || isInLandingGrace)
    {
        // Keep yaw synchronized with actual camera rotation
        Vector3 freestyleEuler = freestyleRotation.eulerAngles;
        targetLook.x = freestyleEuler.y;
        currentLook.x = freestyleEuler.y;
        
        // Track pitch for smooth exit
        rawLookInput.y = Input.GetAxis("Mouse Y");
        float pitchInput = rawLookInput.y * mouseSensitivity;
        if (invertY) pitchInput = -pitchInput;
        
        targetLook.y -= pitchInput;
        targetLook.y = Mathf.Clamp(targetLook.y, -verticalLookLimit, verticalLookLimit);
        currentLook.y = targetLook.y;
        
        return; // Don't accumulate yaw during freestyle
    }
    
    // ... normal look input processing
}
```

## Expected Result
- Standing jump: <5¬∞ deviation, clean landing ‚úÖ
- Target yaw matches pre-jump yaw ‚úÖ
- No crazy -215¬∞ values ‚úÖ

## Test
1. Stand still
2. Middle-click jump
3. Don't touch mouse
4. Land
5. Should see: "CLEAN LANDING! Deviation: 1-3¬∞"

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed, ready for testing
