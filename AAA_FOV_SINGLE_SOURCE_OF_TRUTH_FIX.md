# üî• FOV SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - CRITICAL FIX

## Problem
The FOV system was completely broken due to multiple systems fighting for control:
- **Freestyle trick system** was overriding FOV during aerial tricks (line 1944)
- **Impact system** was scattered and potentially interfering
- **Sprint system** was the intended single source of truth but was being overridden

This caused the FOV to be "completely fucked" with unpredictable behavior.

## Solution
**SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: Only sprinting controls FOV now!**

### Changes Made
1. **Disabled trick system FOV override** (lines 1939-1965)
   - Commented out the entire trick FOV boost section
   - Added clear documentation that FOV is now sprint-only
   - Preserved the code for reference but it's completely disabled

### FOV Control Points (Verified Clean)
The ONLY methods that can modify `targetFOV` are:

1. ‚úÖ **`SetSprintFOV()`** - Called when sprint STARTS
   - Sets `targetFOV = baseFOV + sprintFOVIncrease`
   - Example: 100 + 10 = 110 FOV

2. ‚úÖ **`SetNormalFOV()`** - Called when sprint STOPS
   - Sets `targetFOV = baseFOV`
   - Returns to base FOV (100)

3. ‚úÖ **`OnSprintInterrupted()`** - Called when energy depletes
   - Sets `targetFOV = baseFOV`
   - Emergency reset to base FOV

### How It Works
```
Sprint Start ‚Üí SetSprintFOV() ‚Üí targetFOV = 110
Sprint Stop  ‚Üí SetNormalFOV()  ‚Üí targetFOV = 100
Energy Out   ‚Üí OnSprintInterrupted() ‚Üí targetFOV = 100

UpdateFOVTransition() smoothly lerps currentFOV ‚Üí targetFOV
```

## What Was Removed
- ‚ùå Trick system FOV boost (`trickFOVBoost = 15f`)
- ‚ùå Trick FOV speed control (`trickFOVSpeed = 12f`)
- ‚ùå `freestyleFOV` variable manipulation
- ‚ùå `targetFOV = freestyleFOV` override

## Benefits
‚úÖ **Predictable FOV behavior** - Only sprinting changes FOV
‚úÖ **No more FOV conflicts** - Single source of truth
‚úÖ **Clean code** - No scattered FOV modifications
‚úÖ **Easy to debug** - FOV changes only in 3 methods
‚úÖ **Performance** - No unnecessary FOV calculations during tricks

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Sprint ‚Üí FOV increases to 110
- [ ] Stop sprinting ‚Üí FOV returns to 100
- [ ] Energy depletes ‚Üí FOV returns to 100
- [ ] Aerial tricks ‚Üí FOV stays at current value (no change)
- [ ] Landing ‚Üí FOV stays at current value (no change)
- [ ] Impact system ‚Üí FOV stays at current value (no change)

## Inspector Settings
The following inspector fields are now **UNUSED** but kept for backward compatibility:
- `trickFOVBoost` (was 15f) - No longer affects FOV
- `trickFOVSpeed` (was 12f) - No longer affects FOV

You can safely ignore these fields or set them to 0.

## Code Location
**File**: `AAACameraController.cs`
**Lines**: 1939-1965 (disabled trick FOV section)
**Methods**: `SetSprintFOV()`, `SetNormalFOV()`, `OnSprintInterrupted()`

## Notes
- The trick system still works perfectly - it just doesn't modify FOV anymore
- All other camera effects (shake, tilt, rotation) remain unchanged
- This fix maintains the AAA-quality feel while ensuring FOV predictability
- If you want to re-enable trick FOV in the future, uncomment lines 1943-1965

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - FOV is now exclusively controlled by sprinting
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Priority**: CRITICAL
