# AAA Skull Damage System Fix - Complete

## Problem
Skulls were using instakill logic (`playerHealth.Die()`) when touching the player, bypassing the health system entirely.

## Solution
Replaced instakill logic with proper damage system integration:
- **Skulls now deal 50 HP damage** when they touch the player
- **Skull dies on impact** after dealing damage
- **Integrates with existing health system** (armor plates, regeneration, etc.)
- **Respects all godmode protections**

## Changes Made

### File: `SkullEnemy.cs`
**Method: `OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)`** (Lines 394-446)

#### Before:
```csharp
if (playerHealth != null && !playerHealth.isDead)
{
    playerHealth.Die();  // INSTAKILL - bypasses health system
    inflictedLethalDamage = true;
}
```

#### After:
```csharp
if (playerHealth != null && !playerHealth.isDead)
{
    // Use TakeDamage instead of Die() - deals 50 HP damage
    IDamageable damageable = playerHealth as IDamageable;
    if (damageable != null)
    {
        damageable.TakeDamage(50f, transform.position, (other.transform.position - transform.position).normalized);
        inflictedDamage = true;
    }
}
```

## Godmode Protection - Verified Working

The existing `PlayerHealth.TakeDamage()` method already has **three layers of godmode protection**:

1. **`isInvincible`** - Simple cheat godmode (set by `AAACheatManager`)
2. **`IsInvulnerable`** - Self-revive grace period protection
3. **`IsGodModeActive`** - Godmode powerup with particle effects

All three will **completely block skull damage** - the skull will still die on impact, but you take 0 damage.

## Benefits

✅ **Health System Integration** - Damage now goes through armor plates, triggers regeneration delay, shows blood splat feedback, etc.

✅ **Godmode Works** - All three godmode types now protect against skulls

✅ **Camera Trauma** - Skull hits now trigger camera shake based on damage

✅ **Directional Hit Indicator** - Shows where the skull hit you from

✅ **Balanced Damage** - 50 HP per skull (with 5000 max HP = 100 skulls to kill you)

✅ **Simple & Robust** - Clean code, no edge cases, AAA quality

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Skull deals 50 HP damage on contact
- [ ] Skull dies immediately after hitting player
- [ ] Godmode (`isInvincible`) blocks skull damage
- [ ] Godmode powerup blocks skull damage
- [ ] Self-revive invulnerability blocks skull damage
- [ ] Armor plates absorb skull damage
- [ ] Health regeneration delay triggers after skull hit
- [ ] Blood splat feedback appears on skull hit
- [ ] Camera shake triggers on skull hit
- [ ] Directional hit indicator shows skull attack direction

## Notes

- Companions also take 50 HP damage from skulls (uses same `IDamageable` interface)
- Skull attack sound still plays on impact
- Death effects and stats tracking unchanged
- No performance impact - same collision detection as before
