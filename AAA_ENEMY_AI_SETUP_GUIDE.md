# üéØ AAA Enemy AI - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the setup and configuration of the enhanced enemy AI system inspired by DMZ Building 21. The system provides:

- **Environment-aware behavior** (indoor/outdoor detection)
- **Proper line of sight** (no seeing through walls)
- **Tactical movement** (controlled, non-glitchy)
- **Cover system** (strategic positioning)
- **State-based AI** (patrol, alert, combat, retreat)

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Enhanced EnemyCompanionBehavior (Recommended)
Use the **improved existing system** with all the fixes applied.

1. **Add to enemy GameObject:**
   - `CompanionCore`
   - `CompanionMovement`
   - `CompanionCombat`
   - `CompanionTargeting`
   - `EnemyCompanionBehavior` ‚Üê The enhanced script

2. **Configure Inspector Settings:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Is Enemy: TRUE
   
   DETECTION:
   - Detection Radius: 25000 (25m)
   - Require Line Of Sight: TRUE
   - Line Of Sight Blockers: Set to "Walls" layer
   - LOS Raycast Count: 3
   - Eye Height: 1.8

   ```

### Option 2: TacticalEnemyAI (New System)
Use the **brand new AAA-grade system** with full state machine.

1. **Add to enemy GameObject:**
   - `CompanionCore`
   - `CompanionMovement`
   - `CompanionCombat`
   - `CompanionTargeting`
   - `TacticalEnemyAI` ‚Üê The new script

2. **Configure Inspector Settings:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Is Enemy: TRUE
   
   DETECTION:
   - Detection Range: 30
   - Field Of View: 90
   - Vision Blocking Layers: "Walls"
   - Eye Height: 1.8
   - LOS Raycast Count: 3
   
   MOVEMENT:
   - Patrol Speed: 2
   - Alert Speed: 4
   - Combat Speed: 3
   
   INDOOR BEHAVIOR:
   - Auto Detect Indoors: TRUE
   - Indoor Speed Multiplier: 0.6
   - Disable Jumping Indoors: TRUE
   
   COMBAT:
   - Preferred Combat Distance: 15
   - Accuracy: 0.7
   - Fire Rate: 0.5
   - Burst Duration: 2
   - Burst Cooldown: 1.5
   
   COVER SYSTEM:
   - Use Cover System: TRUE
   - Cover Search Radius: 15
   - Cover Health Threshold: 0.5
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Layer Setup (CRITICAL)

### Required Layers
You **must** set up these layers for proper detection:

1. **Create Layers:**
   - `Walls` - All walls, obstacles, buildings
   - `Ground` - Floor, terrain
   - `Player` - Player character
   - `Enemy` - Enemy characters

2. **Assign Layers:**
   - All building walls ‚Üí `Walls` layer
   - All floors/terrain ‚Üí `Ground` layer
   - Player GameObject ‚Üí `Player` layer
   - Enemy GameObjects ‚Üí `Enemy` layer

3. **Configure LayerMasks:**
   - `lineOfSightBlockers` ‚Üí Select `Walls` layer ONLY
   - `coverLayers` ‚Üí Select `Walls` layer
   - `groundLayers` ‚Üí Select `Ground` layer

### Why This Matters
- **Without proper layers:** Enemies will see through walls
- **With proper layers:** Enemies respect line of sight and use cover

## üéÆ Behavior Comparison

### Before (Old System)
‚ùå Sees through walls  
‚ùå Crazy speed indoors (300x multiplier)  
‚ùå Constant jumping in hallways  
‚ùå Glitchy repositioning  
‚ùå No environment awareness  

### After (Enhanced System)
‚úÖ Proper line of sight with wall detection  
‚úÖ Controlled speed (1.2x, 0.5x indoors)  
‚úÖ No jumping indoors  
‚úÖ Smooth tactical movement  
‚úÖ Auto-detects indoor/outdoor  

---

## üè¢ Indoor vs Outdoor Behavior

### Indoor Mode (Auto-Detected)
When enemy detects ceiling above:
- **Speed:** 50% slower (prevents glitching)
- **Jumping:** Disabled
- **Tactical Movement:** Disabled or reduced
- **Behavior:** Guard-like patrol, controlled engagement

### Outdoor Mode
When no ceiling detected:
- **Speed:** Normal combat speed
- **Jumping:** Enabled (30% chance)
- **Tactical Movement:** Full tactical repositioning
- **Behavior:** Aggressive pursuit, dynamic combat

### Force Indoor Mode
Set `forceIndoorMode = true` to always use indoor behavior regardless of environment.

## üéØ Combat States (TacticalEnemyAI)

### State Machine Flow
```
Idle ‚Üí Patrolling ‚Üí Alert ‚Üí Searching ‚Üí Combat ‚Üí Taking Cover
                                    ‚Üì
                                Retreating
```

### State Descriptions

**Idle**
- Standing still
- Minimal processing

**Patrolling**
- Walking patrol route
- Checking for player periodically
- Smooth hallway movement

**Alert**
- Heard/saw something suspicious
- Moving to investigate
- Increased awareness

**Searching**
- Lost sight of player
- Searching last known position
- Will return to patrol if not found

**Combat**
- Actively engaging player
- Burst fire system
- Tactical positioning (advance/retreat/strafe)

**Taking Cover**
- Health below threshold
- Finding nearest cover
- Peeking out to shoot

**Retreating**
- Low health, falling back
- Seeking cover while moving away

---

## üî´ Combat Configuration

### Burst Fire System
```
Burst Duration: 2s    ‚Üê How long to fire
Burst Cooldown: 1.5s  ‚Üê Pause between bursts
Fire Rate: 0.5s       ‚Üê Time between individual shots
```

This creates realistic combat rhythm:
- Fire for 2 seconds
- Pause for 1.5 seconds
- Repeat

### Accuracy System
```
Accuracy: 0.7 (70%)
```
- 70% chance to aim directly at player
- 30% chance to miss with random offset
- Creates realistic gunfight feel

### Combat Distance
```
Min Distance: 5m      ‚Üê Back up if closer
Preferred: 15m        ‚Üê Ideal combat range
Max Distance: 25m     ‚Üê Advance if farther
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Cover System

### How It Works
1. Enemy takes damage
2. Health drops below threshold (default 50%)
3. Searches for nearest cover within radius
4. Moves to cover position
5. Stays in cover for duration
6. Peeks out to shoot
7. Returns to combat

### Cover Detection
- Finds nearest walls/obstacles
- Positions behind them relative to player
- Scores based on distance and safety

### Configuration
```
Cover Search Radius: 15m
Cover Duration: 3s
Cover Health Threshold: 0.5 (50% health)
```

---

## üö∂ Patrol Setup

### Option A: Waypoint Patrol
1. Create empty GameObjects in your scene
2. Position them along hallway routes
3. Assign to `patrolPoints` array
4. Enemy will walk between them in order

**Best for:** Indoor hallways, guard routes

### Option B: Random Patrol
1. Leave `patrolPoints` empty
2. Set `randomPatrolRadius`
3. Enemy patrols randomly around spawn point

**Best for:** Open areas, outdoor zones

### Patrol Settings
```
Patrol Wait Time: 2s     ‚Üê Time at each waypoint
Random Patrol Radius: 20m ‚Üê Area to patrol if no waypoints
```

---

## üîç Detection System

### Line of Sight
The system uses **multiple raycasts** for accurate detection:

1. **Center ray** - Main detection
2. **Left/Right rays** - Peripheral vision
3. **Up/Down rays** - Full body detection

**Result:** Can't exploit edge cases, realistic detection

### Detection Radius
```
Detection Range: 30m  ‚Üê Maximum sight distance
Field of View: 90¬∞    ‚Üê Cone of vision
```

### Sound Detection (TacticalEnemyAI only)
```
Sound Detection Range: 15m
```
- Hears player even outside FOV
- Triggers alert state
- Investigates sound source

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Enemy sees through walls
**Fix:** Set `lineOfSightBlockers` to `Walls` layer only

### Enemy moves too fast indoors
**Fix:** 
- Set `combatMovementSpeed = 1.2`
- Set `indoorSpeedMultiplier = 0.5`
- Enable `autoDetectIndoors`

### Enemy jumps constantly indoors
**Fix:** Enable `disableJumpingIndoors`

### Enemy doesn't detect player
**Fix:**
- Check `detectionRange` is large enough
- Verify `requireLineOfSight` settings
- Ensure player is in `fieldOfView`

### Enemy glitches/teleports
**Fix:**
- Reduce `combatSpeedMultiplier` to 1.5 or lower
- Increase `repositionInterval` to 1.0+
- Enable indoor detection

### NavMesh issues
**Fix:**
- Bake NavMesh for your scene
- Ensure enemy is on NavMesh
- Check NavMeshAgent settings
