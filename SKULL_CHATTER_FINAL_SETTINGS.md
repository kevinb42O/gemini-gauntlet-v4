# ✅ SKULL CHATTER - FINAL SETTINGS & DEBUG

## **Changes Made**

### **1. Increased Max Chatter Skulls: 3 → 15** 🔊
```csharp
// BEFORE:
private int maxActiveChatterSkulls = 3;

// AFTER:
private int maxActiveChatterSkulls = 15;
```

**Why:** 3 was too quiet and didn't provide enough audio feedback. 15 gives much better spatial awareness while still being optimized.

---

### **2. Added Debug Logging** 🔍

Added console logs to track EXACTLY when sounds stop:

**When skull dies (UnregisterSkull):**
```
[SkullChatterManager] 🛑 STOPPING chatter for skull SkullEnemy(Clone) (IsValid: True, IsPlaying: True)
[SkullChatterManager] ✅ Stopped and invalidated handle for SkullEnemy(Clone)
[SkullChatterManager] 🗑️ Unregistered skull SkullEnemy(Clone). Remaining: 19
```

**When skull moves out of range (UpdateChatterPriorities):**
```
[SkullChatterManager] 🔇 Stopping chatter for SkullEnemy(Clone) (moved out of range)
```

---

## **How to Test**

### **1. Kill a Skull:**
1. Spawn 20 skulls
2. Kill the closest one
3. **Watch console** - you should see:
   - "🛑 STOPPING chatter for skull..."
   - "✅ Stopped and invalidated handle..."
   - "🗑️ Unregistered skull..."

4. **Listen** - chatter should stop INSTANTLY

### **2. Check Audio Quality:**
- With 15 skulls chattering, you should have much better spatial awareness
- Still optimized (only 15 / 100+ skulls)
- Clear audio positioning

---

## **If It STILL Doesn't Stop**

If you see the console logs but sound continues, the issue is in:
- `PooledAudioSource.Stop()` not actually stopping
- `AudioSource.Stop()` not working
- Sound system bug

**Check console for:**
- Do you see the "🛑 STOPPING" log? 
  - YES → Issue is in Stop() method
  - NO → Skull isn't unregistering properly

---

## **Expected Behavior**

### **With 15 Max Chatter:**
- F8 Monitor: "Active Chatter: 15/15" (when 15+ skulls nearby)
- Much better audio feedback
- Still optimized (15 vs 100+)
- Clear spatial positioning

### **When Skull Dies:**
- Console: "🛑 STOPPING chatter..."
- Audio: Stops INSTANTLY
- No fade, no delay

---

## **Settings in Unity**

Make sure `SkullChatterManager` in your scene has:
- **Max Active Chatter Skulls:** 15 ✅
- **Update Interval:** 0.5
- **Max Chatter Distance:** 50

**Test it now and check the console logs!** 🎮✨
