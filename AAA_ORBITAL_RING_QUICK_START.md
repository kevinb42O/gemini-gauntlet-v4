# ⚡ Orbital Ring System - Quick Start

## 🎯 What You Need to Know

### The Problem (FIXED)
- ❌ Platforms spawned randomly between minRadius and maxRadius
- ❌ No control over exact placement
- ❌ No visual feedback in editor

### The Solution (NEW)
- ✅ **Discrete rings** with exact radii
- ✅ **Full manual control** over every ring
- ✅ **Gizmo visualization** shows everything

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (30 Seconds)

### 1. Select Your GameObject
Find the GameObject with `OrbitalSystem` or `UniverseGenerator` component.

### 2. Expand a Tier
In the Inspector, expand one of your **Orbital Tiers**.

### 3. Add Rings
Click the **+** button on the **Rings** list.

### 4. Configure Each Ring
```
Ring 1:
├─ Radius: 30          ← Exact distance from center
├─ Platform Count: 8   ← How many platforms on this ring
├─ Angle Offset: 0°    ← Rotation of the ring
└─ Gizmo Color: Cyan   ← Color in Scene view
```

### 5. Look at Scene View
You'll see:
- Colored ring circles
- Sphere markers where platforms spawn
- Labels with radius and count (when selected)

### 6. Press Play
Platforms spawn **exactly** where the gizmos showed!

## 📋 Typical Configuration

### 3-Ring System (Recommended)
```
Inner Ring:
├─ Radius: 40
├─ Count: 8
├─ Offset: 0°
└─ Color: Cyan

Middle Ring:
├─ Radius: 80
├─ Count: 12
├─ Offset: 22.5°
└─ Color: Yellow

Outer Ring:
├─ Radius: 120
├─ Count: 16
├─ Offset: 45°
└─ Color: Magenta
```

**Result:** 36 platforms on 3 distinct rings, no random spawning!

## 🎨 Gizmo Cheat Sheet

| What You See | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| Colored circle | Ring radius boundary |
| Small sphere | Platform spawn position |
| Line from center | Radial alignment (when selected) |
| Text label | Radius distance & platform count |

**Tip:** Select the GameObject to see brighter gizmos and labels!

---

## ⚙️ Key Settings

### Per Ring:
- **Radius**: Exact distance from center (units)
- **Platform Count**: Number of platforms on this ring
- **Angle Offset**: Rotate the ring (0-360°)
- **Gizmo Color**: Visual color in editor

### Per Tier:
- **Platform Prefab**: What to spawn
- **Fixed Speed**: Orbital speed for all platforms
- **Orbital Plane Variance**: Wobble amount (0-45°)
- **Enemy Spawn Table**: What enemies can spawn

## 🔧 Common Adjustments

### Make Rings Closer Together
```
Ring 1: Radius 30
Ring 2: Radius 40  ← Only 10 units apart
Ring 3: Radius 50
```

### Make Rings Farther Apart
```
Ring 1: Radius 30
Ring 2: Radius 80  ← 50 units apart
Ring 3: Radius 150 ← 70 units apart
```

### Stagger Platform Alignment
```
Ring 1: Offset 0°
Ring 2: Offset 22.5°  ← Platforms don't line up
Ring 3: Offset 45°
```

### More Platforms on Outer Rings
```
Ring 1 (30u): 6 platforms
Ring 2 (60u): 12 platforms  ← Double the count
Ring 3 (90u): 18 platforms  ← Triple the count
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### No More minRadius/maxRadius
The old system is **gone**. You must use **Rings** now.

### Platforms Only Spawn on Defined Rings
If you set:
- Ring 1: Radius 30
- Ring 2: Radius 100

**No platforms spawn between 30-100 units.** This is intentional!

### Gizmos Are Editor-Only
Gizmos don't appear in builds or Play mode. They're just for setup.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No platforms spawn | Add rings to your tier |
| Can't see gizmos | Enable Gizmos in Scene view (top-right) |
| Platforms in wrong place | Check radius value in ring config |
| All platforms same distance | You only have 1 ring, add more |
| Gizmos too faint | Select the GameObject for brighter view |

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Scene View First**: Set up rings visually before testing
2. **Color Code by Distance**: Cyan (close) → Yellow (mid) → Magenta (far)
3. **Stagger Angles**: Prevents straight-line alignment
4. **Test One Ring at a Time**: Add rings incrementally
5. **Frame the Object**: Press `Shift+F` to center camera on gizmos

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Selected GameObject with OrbitalSystem
- [ ] Added at least one ring to a tier
- [ ] Set radius, platform count, and color
- [ ] Checked Scene view for gizmos
- [ ] Gizmos show where you expect platforms
- [ ] Pressed Play to verify

**You're ready to go!** 🎉

## 🎯 Remember

**Old Way:**
```
minRadius: 20
maxRadius: 100
platformCount: 10
→ Random spawning between 20-100 units
```

**New Way:**
```
Ring 1: radius 20, count 3
Ring 2: radius 60, count 4
Ring 3: radius 100, count 3
→ Exact spawning at 20, 60, and 100 units
```

**You now have complete control!** 🚀
