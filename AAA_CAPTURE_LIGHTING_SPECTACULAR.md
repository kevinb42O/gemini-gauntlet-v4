## Moody, Evil, Dramatic Lighting That Makes or Breaks the Experience

---

## 🎭 The Vision

Transform your platform capture from boring to **EPIC** with dynamic lighting that tells a story:

### The Journey:
```
🌑 EVIL & DARK (Pre-Capture)
    ↓
🔴 Dark Red → 💜 Purple → 🔵 Blue (During Capture)
    ↓
⚡ BRIGHT FLASH
    ↓
☀️ BRIGHT & VICTORIOUS (Post-Capture)
```

## ✨ What You Get

### Pre-Capture (Evil/Tense):
- **Dark red lighting** - Oppressive, dangerous atmosphere
- **Heavy fog** - Thick, ominous red fog
- **Low intensity** - Barely visible, moody
- **Ambient darkness** - Deep shadows everywhere

### During Capture (Gradual Transformation):
- **0-25%**: Dark red → Purple-red (tension building)
- **25-50%**: Purple-red → Purple-blue (hope emerging)
- **50-75%**: Purple-blue → Blue (turning the tide)
- **75-100%**: Blue → Bright white (victory approaching)
- **Pulsing effect**: Light pulses with heartbeat rhythm
- **Flickering**: Dramatic flickers at 25%, 50%, 75% milestones
- **Intensity increase**: Gradually gets brighter

### Post-Capture (Victory):
- **Bright white flash**: Blinding victory moment
- **Warm white light**: Triumphant, safe atmosphere
- **Clear fog**: Light blue, barely visible
- **High intensity**: Everything is bright and visible
- **Ambient brightness**: No more shadows

## 🚀 Setup (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Lighting Controller

1. **Create empty GameObject**: `CaptureLightingController`
2. **Add component**: `CaptureLightingController.cs`

### Step 2: Assign Lights

In Inspector:
- **Directional Light**: Drag your main sun/moon light
- **Additional Lights**: Drag any point lights, spotlights you want controlled

### Step 3: Connect to Capture System

1. **Select your PlatformCaptureSystem**
2. **In Inspector, "Audio & VFX" section:**
   - **Lighting Controller**: Drag your CaptureLightingController GameObject

### Done! ✅

The system will automatically:
- Set evil atmosphere on start
- Update lighting as capture progresses
- Trigger victory flash on completion

## ⚙️ Customization

### Make It Even Darker:
```
Pre-Capture Intensity: 0.1 (instead of 0.3)
Pre-Capture Fog Density: 0.04 (instead of 0.02)
Ambient: (0.05, 0.02, 0.02) - Almost black
```

### More Dramatic Flash:
```
Victory Flash Duration: 1.0s (instead of 0.5s)
Flash Intensity: 3.0 (instead of 2.4)
```

### Faster Transitions:
```
Pulse Frequency: 2.0 Hz (instead of 0.5 Hz)
Pulse Intensity: 0.3 (instead of 0.15)
```

### Different Color Journey:
```
25%: Green-red (toxic)
50%: Yellow (neutral)
75%: Orange (warm)
100%: Gold (victory)
```

## 🎮 How It Works

### Automatic Integration:
1. **On scene start**: Sets evil pre-capture atmosphere
2. **Player enters radius**: Lighting starts transitioning
3. **Every frame**: Updates lighting based on progress %
4. **On completion**: Triggers victory flash sequence

### Progress-Based:
- Lighting is tied directly to capture progress (0-100%)
- Smooth interpolation between color stages
- No jarring transitions, everything flows

### Layered Effects:
- Base color transition (smooth gradient)
- Pulsing effect (adds life)
- Flickering (adds drama)
- Victory flash (adds impact)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Maximum Impact:
1. **Start dark**: Make pre-capture REALLY dark (intensity 0.1-0.2)
2. **Big contrast**: Make post-capture REALLY bright (intensity 1.5-2.0)
3. **Slow pulse**: Keep pulse frequency low (0.3-0.5 Hz) for ominous feel
4. **Enable all effects**: Pulsing + Flickering + Victory Flash = EPIC

### For Subtle Approach:
1. **Less contrast**: Keep intensity range 0.5-1.0
2. **Disable flickering**: Smooth transitions only
3. **Shorter flash**: 0.2s flash duration
4. **Lower pulse**: 0.1 pulse intensity

### For Horror Vibes:
1. **Very dark**: Pre-capture intensity 0.05
2. **Red/black**: Use deep red/black colors
3. **Heavy fog**: 0.05 fog density
4. **Fast pulse**: 2 Hz for anxiety

## 🎬 The Complete Experience

### Player Perspective:

**Approaching platform:**
- "Whoa, it's so dark and red... this looks dangerous"

**Starting capture (0-25%):**
- "The light is changing... purple? What's happening?"
- *Flicker at 25%* - "Whoa!"

**Mid-capture (25-50%):**
