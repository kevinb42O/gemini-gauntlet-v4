# üîß MOVEMENT SMOOTHING FIX V2 - CORRECTED

## ‚ùå WHAT WENT WRONG

The velocity smoothing was **broken** - it was creating a new Vector3 from zero every frame instead of using current velocity!

```csharp
// BROKEN CODE (REMOVED):
targetHorizontalVelocity = Vector3.SmoothDamp(
    new Vector3(velocitySmoothRef.x, 0, velocitySmoothRef.z), // ‚ùå Creates new vector!
    targetHorizontalVelocity,
    ref velocitySmoothRef,
    velocitySmoothTime
);
```

This caused the smoothing to **accumulate** instead of smooth, making you fly sideways!

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

### Removed Broken Velocity Smoothing
- Deleted the second smoothing layer (it was wrong)
- **Input smoothing alone** is enough for AAA feel

### Reduced Input Smoothing
- Changed from `0.18f` ‚Üí `0.10f` (more conservative)
- Still smooth, but more responsive
- You can adjust in Inspector if needed

---

## üéÆ CURRENT SETTINGS

**Single-Stage Input Smoothing:**
- `inputSmoothTime = 0.10f` (default)

**How to tune:**
- `0.05-0.08` = Very responsive (competitive)
- `0.10-0.12` = Balanced AAA feel (current)
- `0.15-0.20` = Smooth but slower response

---

## üîß INSPECTOR ADJUSTMENT

Open **AAAMovementController** ‚Üí **INPUT SMOOTHING (AAA FEEL)**:

**Input Direction Smoothing Time:** `0.10`
- Start here and adjust to taste
- Higher = smoother but less responsive
- Lower = snappier but might feel jerky

---

## üéØ RESULT

‚úÖ No more flying sideways!
‚úÖ Smooth input transitions
‚úÖ Responsive controls
‚úÖ Single, correct smoothing layer

**Test it now - should feel much better!** üöÄ
