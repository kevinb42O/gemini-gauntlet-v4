# Mouse Button to Hand Mapping Fix

## Problem
The mouse button to hand mapping was backwards:
- **LMB (Left Mouse Button)** controlled the **RIGHT hand**
- **RMB (Right Mouse Button)** controlled the **LEFT hand**

This was counter-intuitive and confusing.

## Solution Applied
Swapped the mapping to be intuitive:
- **LMB (Left Mouse Button)** now controls the **LEFT hand** âœ…
- **RMB (Right Mouse Button)** now controls the **RIGHT hand** âœ…

## Changes Made

### File: `PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs`

**Animation System Calls (6 changes):**
1. Line 310: Primary shotgun - `false` â†’ `true` (left hand)
2. Line 357: Primary beam start - `false` â†’ `true` (left hand)
3. Line 402: Primary beam stop - `false` â†’ `true` (left hand)
4. Line 429: Secondary shotgun - `true` â†’ `false` (right hand)
5. Line 476: Secondary beam start - `true` â†’ `false` (right hand)
6. Line 521: Secondary beam stop - `true` â†’ `false` (right hand)

**Emit Point Assignments (2 changes):**
- Line 568-572: Primary hand now updates **leftHandEmitPoint** (was rightHandEmitPoint)
- Line 618-622: Secondary hand now updates **rightHandEmitPoint** (was leftHandEmitPoint)

**Homing Dagger Logic (1 change):**
- Line 743: `isPrimaryHand ? leftHandEmitPoint : rightHandEmitPoint` (swapped)

**Auto-Assignment Method (1 change):**
- Lines 1056-1074: `AutoAssignHandEmitPoints()` now correctly assigns primaryâ†’left, secondaryâ†’right

**Documentation Updates:**
- Updated all comments and tooltips to reflect new mapping
- Added "(PRIMARY/LMB)" and "(SECONDARY/RMB)" labels for clarity

## Complexity Assessment
âœ… **EXTREMELY SAFE & EASY**
- Only one file modified (`PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs`)
- Simple boolean parameter flips
- No breaking changes to other systems
- All other systems use the `isPrimaryHand` boolean correctly

## Systems That Work Correctly (No Changes Needed)
- `HandUIManager.cs` - Uses `isPrimaryHand` boolean, works correctly
- `ShootingActionController.cs` - Uses `isPrimaryHand` boolean, works correctly
- `LayeredHandAnimationController.cs` - Receives correct boolean from orchestrator
- `PlayerAnimationStateManager.cs` - Receives correct boolean from orchestrator
- All particle systems - Use boolean parameter correctly

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] LMB fires left hand shotgun
- [ ] LMB hold fires left hand beam
- [ ] RMB fires right hand shotgun
- [ ] RMB hold fires right hand beam
- [ ] Homing daggers spawn from correct hands
- [ ] Hand animations play on correct hands
- [ ] Overheat particles appear on correct hands
- [ ] UI displays correct hand levels/gems

## Result
The mouse button mapping is now intuitive and matches player expectations! ðŸŽ®
