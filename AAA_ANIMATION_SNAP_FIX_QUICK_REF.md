# 🎬 Animation Snap Fix - Quick Reference

## ❌ THE BUG
Animations snapping to idle before completing, regardless of exit time settings.

## ✅ THE FIX
Changed from hardcoded delays to dynamic animation completion detection.

---

## 🔧 WHAT WAS CHANGED

### Old Code (Broken):
```csharp
handAnimator.SetTrigger("SwordRevealT");
_resetShootingCoroutine = StartCoroutine(ResetShootingState(1.5f)); // ❌ Hardcoded
```

### New Code (Fixed):
```csharp
handAnimator.SetTrigger("SwordRevealT");
_resetShootingCoroutine = StartCoroutine(ResetShootingStateWhenAnimationFinishes("SwordReveal")); // ✅ Dynamic
```

---

## 📋 FIXED ANIMATIONS

| Animation | Old Delay | New System |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Sword Reveal** | 1.5s (too short!) | ✅ Waits for actual length |
| **Sword Attack** | 0.7s | ✅ Waits for actual length |
| **Power Attack** | 1.0s | ✅ Waits for actual length |
| **Shotgun** | 0.5s | ✅ Waits for actual length |

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

Uses `AnimatorStateInfo.normalizedTime` to detect when animation is 95% complete:
- `0.0` = Start (0%)
- `0.5` = Halfway (50%)
- `0.95` = Almost done (95%) ← We wait for this!
- `1.0` = Complete (100%)

---

## 🧪 QUICK TEST

1. Set sword reveal animation to **5+ seconds**
2. Press **Backspace** to activate sword mode
3. **Expected**: Full animation plays without snapping
4. **Old Bug**: Would snap after 1.5 seconds

---

## 💡 KEY BENEFITS

✅ Works with ANY animation length (1s, 5s, 10s+)  
✅ No code changes when adjusting animation clips  
✅ Supports animation speed multipliers  
✅ Consistent across all animation types  

---

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

- `IndividualLayeredHandController.cs` - Added `ResetShootingStateWhenAnimationFinishes()` method

**Fixed**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

🎬 **Your 5-second animations are now safe!** 🎬
