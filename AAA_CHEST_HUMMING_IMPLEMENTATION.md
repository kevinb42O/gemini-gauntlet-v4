# 📦 AAA Chest Humming Sound System - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Your beautiful glowing chests now have **proximity-based ambient humming sounds** that play when you get close to them! The system automatically handles distance-based volume and cleanup.

---

## 🎵 How It Works

### **Automatic Behavior**
- **Humming starts** when a chest is in the `Closed` state (ready for interaction)
- **Humming stops** when the chest is opened or hidden
- **Distance-based volume** - gets louder as you approach
- **Auto-cleanup** - sounds automatically stop when you're too far away

### **Distance Settings** (configurable in ChestSoundManager)
- **Min Distance**: 500 units - where humming starts to fade in
- **Max Distance**: 1500 units - where humming is at full volume (you can hear it from here!)
- **Auto-Cleanup Distance**: 2000 units - sounds stop automatically beyond this range

   - Proximity-based humming with spatial audio
   - Automatic distance-based cleanup
   - Volume control and fade effects

### **Modified Files**
1. **`SoundEvents.cs`** - Added `chestHumming` sound event field
   - Located in the `COLLECTIBLES: Chests` section
   - Supports looping audio clips

2. **`ChestController.cs`** - Integrated ChestSoundManager
   - Auto-adds ChestSoundManager component in `Awake()`
   - Starts humming when chest becomes `Closed`

## 🎮 How to Assign Your Chest Hum Sound

### **Step 1: Find Your SoundEvents Asset**
1. In Unity, navigate to your **SoundEvents** ScriptableObject
2. Usually located in `Assets/Audio/` or similar

### **Step 2: Assign the Chest Humming Sound**
1. Scroll down to the **"COLLECTIBLES: Chests"** section
2. Find the new **"Chest Humming"** field
3. Assign your audio clip to this field
4. Configure the sound settings:
   - **Volume**: 0.6-0.8 recommended (needs to be audible from distance)
   - **Pitch**: 1.0 (or slightly lower for deeper hum)
   - **Loop**: ✅ **MUST BE CHECKED** (this is a looping sound)
   - **Category**: SFX

### **Step 3: Test In-Game**
1. Play your game
2. Approach a chest
3. Listen for the humming sound to fade in
4. Walk away and it should fade out automatically

## 🎛️ Customization Options

### **Per-Chest Volume Control**
Each chest has an `audioVolume` field (0-1) that multiplies all chest sounds including humming.

### **ChestSoundManager Settings** (Inspector)
If you want to adjust the humming behavior:
- **Humming Volume**: Base volume for the hum (default: 0.4)
- **Min Humming Distance**: When sound starts being audible
- **Max Humming Distance**: When sound reaches full volume
- **Max Audible Distance**: When sound auto-stops (cleanup)

### **Advanced: Spatial Audio Profile**
The system uses AAA spatial audio with:
- **60° spread** - wider ambient feel
- **Low priority** - won't interfere with important sounds
- **0.8s fade out** - smooth transitions

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **State-Based Activation**
```
Hidden → (no humming)
Emerging → (no humming)
Closed → ✅ START HUMMING
Opening → ❌ STOP HUMMING
Open → (no humming)
Interacted → (no humming)
```

### **Automatic Component Management**
- ChestSoundManager is automatically added to all chests
- No manual setup required in the scene
- Works for both **Manual** and **Spawned** chest types

### **Memory Management**
- Sounds automatically clean up when chests are destroyed
- Distance-based culling prevents performance issues
- Smooth fade-outs prevent audio popping

## 🎨 Sound Design Tips

### **Recommended Audio Characteristics**
- **Type**: Ambient loop, mystical/magical hum
- **Length**: 2-5 seconds (seamless loop)
- **Frequency**: Mid-low range (200-800 Hz)
- **Texture**: Ethereal, glowing, mysterious
- **Volume**: Subtle - should be atmospheric, not intrusive

### **Example Sound Ideas**
- Soft crystalline resonance
- Magical energy hum
- Gentle wind chime ambience
- Low frequency pulse/throb
- Ethereal choir pad

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **No Sound Playing?**
1. Check that `chestHumming` is assigned in SoundEvents
2. Verify the audio clip has **Loop** enabled
3. Ensure the chest is in `Closed` state (check Inspector)
4. Check that you're within the max audible distance

### **Sound Too Loud/Quiet?**
1. Adjust `hummingVolume` in ChestSoundManager (Inspector)
2. Adjust `audioVolume` on the ChestController
3. Modify the SoundEvent volume in SoundEvents asset

### **Sound Not Stopping?**
- The system automatically stops sounds when:
  - Chest is opened
  - Chest is destroyed
  - Player moves too far away
- If issues persist, check the console for debug logs
