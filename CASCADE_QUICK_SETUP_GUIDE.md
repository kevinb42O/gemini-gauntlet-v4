# 🚀 CASCADE INTELLIGENT DEBUG - 5 MINUTE SETUP

## ✅ STEP 1: Create Smart Debug Profile (30 seconds)

1. **Right-click** in your Project window
2. Navigate to: `Create > Cascade Debug > Smart Debug Profile`
3. Name it something meaningful: `GameOptimizationProfile`

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Configure Profile (2 minutes)

### Open the profile in Inspector

### Add Scripts to Track
**Drag MonoBehaviour scripts** from your Project into the `Target Scripts` list.

**Recommended scripts to start with:**
- `LayeredHandAnimationController`
- `AAAMovementController`
- `EnergySystem`
- `CleanAAACrouch`
- `PlayerHealth` (if you have it)

**Pro Tip:** Start with 3-5 scripts. You can always add more later!

### Configure Settings (Use These Defaults)
```
✓ Track Public Fields
✓ Track Serialized Fields
✓ Track Properties
✗ Track Method Calls (expensive!)

Sampling Interval: 0.5
✓ Log Only On Change
✓ Track Statistics

✓ Separate File Per Script
✓ Include Timestamp
✗ Export As JSON (use text for now)

✓ Track Component References
✓ Track Hierarchy Context
✓ Track Performance Metrics
```

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Add to Scene (1 minute)

### Option A: Create New GameObject
1. **Right-click** in Hierarchy
2. Create Empty GameObject
3. Name it `CascadeDebugManager`

### Option B: Use Existing GameObject
1. Find your existing debug/manager object
2. Select it

### Add the Component
1. Click `Add Component`
2. Search for `CascadeDebugManager`
3. Add it

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Configure Manager (1 minute)

### In the Inspector:

#### 🧠 Intelligent Tracking Section
1. **Drag your profile** into `Intelligent Profile` field
2. Ensure these are checked:
   - ✓ Enable Intelligent Logging
   - ✓ Enable Contextual Tracking
   - ✓ Enable AI Reporting

#### 📦 Classic Tool Components (Optional)
```
✓ Add Animation Logger (if you want animation tracking)
✓ Add Component Dumper (for component snapshots)
✓ Add Scene Exporter (for hierarchy exports)
✓ Add Log Reader (for Unity console logs)
```

#### ⚡ Quick Actions
```
✓ Export On Start (automatic export when game starts)
Export All Key: F12 (press F12 during gameplay to export)
```

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Play and Analyze (30 seconds)

### Press Play!

You'll see in the Console:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🧠 CASCADE MAXIMUM CONTROL MODE - ULTIMATE AI INTELLIGENCE!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ IntelligentDebugLogger added - per-script tracking enabled!
✅ ContextualInspectorTracker added - smart value tracking enabled!
✅ AIOptimizationReporter added - AI-driven optimization enabled!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📂 All exports will be saved to: CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/
🧠 Intelligent logs: CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/IntelligentLogs/
🎯 Context tracking: CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/ContextualTracking/
🤖 AI reports: CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/OptimizationReports/
⚡ Press F12 to export EVERYTHING instantly!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Play for 1-2 Minutes
Just play your game normally. The system is tracking everything!

### Check Your Files
Navigate to your project root folder and find:
```
CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/
├── IntelligentLogs/          ← Separate file per script!
├── ContextualTracking/       ← Pattern analysis
└── OptimizationReports/      ← AI insights
```

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NEXT

### 1. Read the AI Optimization Report First
```
CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/OptimizationReports/AI_Optimization_Report_1_[timestamp].txt
```

This tells you:
- What issues were found
- Priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Specific recommendations
- Impact scores

### 2. Check Individual Script Logs
```
CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/IntelligentLogs/[ScriptName]_[timestamp].txt
```

See exactly what values are changing and when.

### 3. Review Pattern Analysis
```
CASCADE_DEBUG_EXPORTS/ContextualTracking/ContextualAnalysis_[timestamp].txt
```

Discover:
- Oscillating values
- Stuck values
- Rapid changes
- Optimization suggestions

## 🔥 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### "No SmartDebugProfile assigned!"
**Fix:** Drag your profile asset into the `Intelligent Profile` field in CascadeDebugManager.

### "No instances found for [ScriptName]"
**Fix:** Make sure the script is actually in your scene and attached to a GameObject with the "Player" tag (or add the GameObject to `Manual Targets`).

### "No files generated"
**Fix:** 
1. Check Console for errors
2. Ensure `Enable All Tools` is checked
3. Make sure you played the game for at least a few seconds

### Files are empty or minimal
**Fix:**
1. Play longer (at least 30 seconds)
2. Actually interact with the systems you're tracking
3. Check `Log Only On Change` - values might not be changing

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR FIRST USE

### Start Small
Track 3-5 scripts maximum for your first session. You can always add more!

### Focus on Problem Areas
If animations are buggy, track animation scripts. If movement feels off, track movement scripts.

### Play Actively
Don't just stand still! Move around, jump, shoot, interact - generate data!

### Check Reports Every 30 Seconds
AI Optimization Reports generate every 30 seconds. Watch the Console for updates.

### Use F12 Liberally
Press F12 whenever you notice something weird. It captures that exact moment!

## 🎮 EXAMPLE FIRST SESSION

### Goal: Optimize Animation System

**Profile Setup:**
```
Target Scripts:
  - LayeredHandAnimationController
  - IndividualLayeredHandController
  - PlayerAnimationStateManager
```

**Play Session:**
1. Press Play
2. Move around for 30 seconds
3. Jump, sprint, shoot, crouch
4. Press F12 to capture
5. Stop playing

**Analysis:**
1. Open `OptimizationReports/` folder
2. Read the latest report
3. Look for HIGH priority issues
4. Check `IntelligentLogs/` for specific scripts mentioned
5. Review `ContextualTracking/` for patterns

**Result:**
You now have specific, actionable insights about your animation system!

## 🆘 NEED HELP?

### Check the Full Documentation
Read `CASCADE_INTELLIGENT_DEBUG_SYSTEM.md` for complete details.

### Common Questions

**Q: How much performance overhead?**
A: Minimal! Sampling-based (not every frame) and only logs changes.

**Q: Can I use in production builds?**
A: Disable it! Set `enableAllTools = false` or use `#if UNITY_EDITOR`.

**Q: How many scripts can I track?**
A: Technically unlimited, but start with 5-10 for best results.

**Q: Can I track enemy scripts?**
A: Yes! Add enemies to `Manual Targets` in IntelligentDebugLogger.

**Q: Files are huge!**
A: Enable `Log Only On Change` and increase `Sampling Interval`.
