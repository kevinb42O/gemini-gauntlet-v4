## 🏗️ EXISTING SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **1. MOVEMENT SYSTEM** 
**Primary Controller**: `AAAMovementController.cs` (2779 lines)

**Current Architecture**:
```
CharacterController (Unity built-in physics)
├── Ground Detection (coyote time, ray-based checks)
├── Velocity Management (external velocity injection API)
├── Jump System (double-jump, wall-jump with momentum preservation)
├── Air Control (28% control, momentum-based physics)
├── Steep Slope Handling (auto-slide on 45°+ slopes)
└── State Tracking (IsGrounded, TimeSinceGrounded, IsFalling)
```

**Integration Points**:
- `CleanAAACrouch.cs` - Crouch/slide controller (ownership-based CharacterController modification)
- `PlayerAnimationStateManager.cs` - Centralized animation state coordinator
- `AAACameraController.cs` - Camera effects (FOV, shake, landing impact)
- `FallingDamageSystem.cs` - Fall distance tracking

**Known Optimizations**:
- Single Source of Truth principle (no state duplication)
- Frame-rate independent physics (Time.deltaTime scaling)
- Slope detection with configurable thresholds
- Pristine controller modification stacks (nested overrides)

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Per-frame ground detection raycasts (FixedUpdate)
- Velocity blending calculations
- Slope normal recalculation on every ground check
- Multiple GetComponent calls in Update loop

---

### **2. COMBAT SYSTEM**
**Primary Controllers**: 
- `PlayerShooterOrchestrator.cs` (1111 lines) - Central command
- `HandFiringMechanics.cs` (1558 lines) - Per-hand weapon logic

**Current Architecture**:
```
PlayerShooterOrchestrator (Singleton)
├── Primary Hand (HandFiringMechanics)
│   ├── Shotgun Mode (raycast + VFX spawning)
│   ├── Stream Mode (continuous damage + beam VFX)
│   └── Level-based configs (HandLevelSO)
├── Secondary Hand (HandFiringMechanics)
└── Homing Dagger System (pooled projectiles)
```

**VFX Management**:
- Object pooling via `ObjectPooler.cs` (reduces instantiation overhead)
- Active VFX tracking (maxActiveShotgunVFX = 10, prevents particle buildup)
- Static list cleanup (5-second intervals to remove null references)

**Known Optimizations**:
- Centralized audio control (prevents duplicate sound playback)
- Raycast hit buffer reuse (RaycastHit[] _hitBuffer)
- Component caching (LayeredHandAnimationController, AAACameraController)

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Raycast performance (per-shot raycasts with 50-element buffer)
- Particle system instantiation overhead (even with pooling)
- Stream damage raycasts (continuous per-frame checks during beam firing)
- Material duplication on VFX spawn

---

### **3. AI SYSTEM - COMPANION ARCHITECTURE**
**Modular Design**: `CompanionAI/` namespace (6 core components)

**Component Breakdown**:
```
CompanionCore.cs (Main Coordinator)
├── CompanionMovement.cs (NavMesh-based tactical movement)
│   ├── Following mode (stick close to player)
│   ├── Engaging mode (close distance to enemies)
│   └── Combat mode (strafe, backpedal, circle, jump)
├── CompanionTargeting.cs (Enemy detection & threat assessment)
│   ├── Sphere overlap detection (detectionRadius)
│   ├── LOS validation (raycasts to verify visibility)
│   └── Threat prioritization (closest, lowest health)
├── CompanionCombat.cs (Weapon control)
│   ├── Shotgun attacks (cooldown-based)
│   ├── Stream attacks (continuous beam damage)
│   └── Area damage system (12-entity collider buffer)
├── CompanionAudio.cs (3D spatial audio)
└── CompanionVisualEffects.cs (Combat state glow effects)
```

**Enemy Companion System**: `EnemyCompanionBehavior.cs`
- Hijacks friendly companion system (reference override technique)
- Creates "fake player" GameObject for AI targeting
- Disables friendly targeting system (CompanionTargeting)
- Tactical movement enabled (strafe, backpedal, combat repositioning)

**Known Optimizations**:
- Component caching (Start() instead of GetComponent in Update)
- Player transform caching (2-second cache duration)
- LOD system for distant enemies (reduced update rates)
- Line-of-sight validation before shooting

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- LOS raycasts (per-enemy, per-attack: 20-34 raycasts/sec/enemy BEFORE optimization)
- NavMesh pathfinding costs (per-enemy recalculation)
- Area damage collision checks (OverlapSphere, 12-element buffer)
- Enemy count scaling (5+ enemies = 100+ raycasts/sec)

---

### **4. AI SYSTEM - SKULL ENEMIES**
**Primary Controller**: `SkullEnemy.cs` (1415 lines)

**Current Architecture**:
```
Rigidbody-based flying AI
├── State Machine (Spawning → Hunting → Attacking → Decaying)
├── Attack Patterns (DirectAssault, SwoopingDive, CirclingPredator)
├── Separation System (anti-clustering, avoids other skulls)
├── Ground Avoidance (maintains 3m clearance, raycast-based)
└── LOD System (adjusts update rates based on distance)
```

**Known Optimizations**:
- Staggered AI tick system (0.08-0.16s intervals instead of per-frame)
- Separation calculation throttling (0.15s intervals, 6x per second)
- Ground check throttling (0.2s intervals, 5x per second instead of FixedUpdate)
- Non-alloc overlap sphere (reusable collider buffer)
- Cached component arrays (Renderer[], ParticleSystem[])
- Static player transform caching (avoid FindGameObjectWithTag per-frame)

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Still doing ground raycasts at 5 Hz per enemy
- Separation checks even for distant skulls (LOD not fully optimized)
- Potential GC from trail effect instantiation
- Material property block updates for hit glow

---

### **5. ANIMATION SYSTEM**
**Centralized Coordinator**: `PlayerAnimationStateManager.cs` (786 lines)

**Architecture**:
```
Single Source of Truth Pattern
├── State Management (Idle, Walk, Sprint, Jump, Land, Dive, Slide, Flight, Falling)
├── Hand Animation Control (LayeredHandAnimationController integration)
├── Action Tracking (shooting, beaming, emoting, armor plating)
└── One-shot Animation System (Jump/Land with duration tracking)
```

**Hand Animation System**: `LayeredHandAnimationController.cs`
- Dual-hand independent control (left/right hand emotes)
- Layer-based animation (Base layer + additive layers)
- Animation profile system for different hand levels

**Known Optimizations**:
- LateUpdate for auto-detection (prevents fighting with manual triggers)
- State change cooldown (0.05s to prevent spam)
- Manual state override duration (0.1s protection window)
- Action cooldown dictionary (prevents duplicate triggers)

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Multiple Animator state checks per frame

- Idle delay system (continuous time checks)

---

### **6. CAMERA SYSTEM**
**Primary Controller**: `AAACameraController.cs` (1199 lines)

**Architecture**:
```
Frame-perfect camera control
├── Look System (Update: mouse input, LateUpdate: apply rotation)
├── FOV Transition (smooth interpolation, idle until target reached)
├── Head Bob (synchronized with footsteps, period-based)
├── Strafe Tilt (smooth spring-based lateral tilt)
├── Wall Jump Tilt (dynamic tilt with curve-based animation)
├── Landing Impact (spring compression system with over-damping)
├── Camera Shake (beam shake + shotgun shake + trauma system)
└── Idle Sway (subtle breathing motion)
```

**Known Optimizations**:
- Smart FOV updates (only interpolate when transitioning, not every frame)
- Component caching (Camera, AAAMovementController)
- Rotation preservation (baseYawRotation to avoid snapping)
- Decoupled hands system (optional, currently disabled)

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Multiple Update/LateUpdate effect calculations per frame
- Perlin noise calls for shake effects (expensive)
- Curve evaluation every frame for multiple effects
- Spring physics calculations for landing impact

---

**Primary Controller**: `InventoryManager.cs` (2049 lines)

**Architecture**:
```
Context-based inventory (Game vs Menu)
├── Slot Management (UnifiedSlot, specialized slots)
├── Item System (ChestItemData, various item types)
├── Persistence (PersistentItemInventoryManager integration)
├── UI Visibility Control (backpack system, 5-24 slots)
└── Gem Collection System (simple counter)
```

**Known Optimizations**:
- Scene-aware singleton (Game vs Menu context separation)
- Event-driven updates (OnItemAdded, OnInventoryChanged)
- Lazy slot initialization

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Frequent slot UI updates (potentially every item change)
- Item serialization/deserialization overhead
- FindObjectOfType calls during Start()
- Scene persistence complexity

---

### **8. POOLING & VFX MANAGEMENT**
**Object Pooler**: `ObjectPooler.cs` (278 lines)
- Tag-based pool system
- Dynamic growth support
- Reusable GameObject queues
- Per-pool organization (parent transforms)

**Particle Systems**:

- Pool-based VFX spawning (prevents instantiation spikes)
- Active VFX tracking and cleanup

**Known Optimizations**:
- Static list cleanup (5-second intervals)
- MaxActiveVFX limits (prevents buildup)
- IPooledObject interface for lifecycle management

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Null reference accumulation in static lists
- Particle system startup cost even when pooled
- Material duplication on particle spawn
- No automatic pool warming
