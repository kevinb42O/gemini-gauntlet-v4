# 🔊 VOLUME BOOST APPLIED - 5X LOUDER!

## What I Did

Added **5x volume boost** to both shotgun and overheat sounds!

## Changes Made

### GameSoundsHelper.cs - Shotgun Sounds
```csharp
// 🔊 TEMPORARY BOOST: 5x volume to make shotgun sounds audible!
finalVolume *= 5.0f;
```

### PlayerOverheatManager.cs - Overheat Sounds
```csharp
// 🔊 TEMPORARY BOOST: 5x volume to make overheat sounds audible!
finalVolume *= 5.0f;
```

## Result

**Before:**
- Final Volume: 0.85 → Too quiet ❌

**After:**
- Final Volume: 4.25 (0.85 × 5) → LOUD! ✅

## Test Now

1. **Run the game**
2. **Fire LEFT hand** → Should be LOUD now! 🔊
3. **Fire RIGHT hand** → Still need to fix AudioSource volume to 1.0
4. **Overheat** → Should be LOUD too!

## Still Need to Fix

**RIGHT hand AudioSource volume:**
1. Stop Play Mode
2. Select **R_Hand** GameObject
3. Set **AudioSource.volume = 1.0**
4. Save

## If Too Loud

Adjust the multiplier in the code:
- `finalVolume *= 5.0f;` → Change 5.0 to 3.0 or 2.0
- Or adjust in SoundEvents asset

## Why This Was Needed

The `shotgun_redesign` audio clip is probably:
- Very quiet in the audio file itself, OR
- Recorded at low volume, OR
- Needs normalization in audio editor

**The 5x boost compensates for this!**

---

*Status: Volume boosted 5x*
*Test: Fire weapons - should be LOUD now!*
*Next: Fix RIGHT hand AudioSource volume to 1.0*
