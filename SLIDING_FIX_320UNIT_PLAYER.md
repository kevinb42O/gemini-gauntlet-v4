# üé¢ SLIDING SYSTEM FIX - 320-UNIT PLAYER

## üö® ROOT CAUSE:
Your CleanAAACrouch Inspector values are NOT scaled for your 320-unit character!
The code defaults are for ~100-unit characters. You need 3x larger values!

## ‚úÖ CORRECT INSPECTOR VALUES (Copy these EXACTLY):

### üéØ **CRITICAL SPEED VALUES** (3x scale):
```
slideMinStartSpeed = 105 (was 35 - now 3x)
slideAutoStandSpeed = 75 (was 25 - now 3x)
slideMaxSpeed = 5040 (was 1680 - now 3x)
```

### ‚ö° **ACCELERATION & FRICTION** (3x scale):
```
slideGravityAccel = 3240 (was 1080 - now 3x for proper downhill acceleration)
slideFrictionFlat = 36 (was 12 - now 3x to maintain same feel)
slideSteerAcceleration = 1200 (was 400 - now 3x for responsive steering)
```

### üé™ **GROUND DETECTION** (3x scale):
```
slideGroundCheckDistance = 600 (was 200 - now 3x for proper ground detection)
stickToGroundVelocity = 66 (was 22 - now 3x)
```

### üèîÔ∏è **DIVE SYSTEM** (3x scale):
```
diveForwardForce = 2160 (was 720 - now 3x)
diveUpwardForce = 720 (was 240 - now 3x)
diveMinSprintSpeed = 960 (was 320 - now 3x)
diveSlideFriction = 5400 (was 1800 - now 3x)
```

### üöÄ **RAMP LAUNCH** (3x scale):
```
rampMinSpeed = 420 (was 140 - now 3x)
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **TIMING VALUES** (Keep these - they're time-based, not distance):
```
slideGroundCoyoteTime = 0.30 (KEEP)
momentumPreservation = 0.96 (KEEP - this is a percentage!)
uphillFrictionMultiplier = 4 (KEEP - multiplier)
```

### üìè **HEIGHT VALUES** (3x scale):
```
standingHeight = 225 (was 75 - now 3x for 320-unit character)
crouchedHeight = 96 (was 32 - now 3x)
standingCameraY = 225 (was 75 - now 3x)
crouchedCameraY = 96 (was 32 - now 3x)
```

## üî• CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:

### **1. GROUND CHECK DISTANCE IS TOO SMALL!**
If `slideGroundCheckDistance = 200`, you're only checking 200 units below a 320-unit character!
That's like checking 0.6x your height - you'll lose ground contact constantly!

**FIX:** Set to **600** (2x your height for safety)

### **2. SPEED THRESHOLDS TOO LOW!**
If `slideMinStartSpeed = 35`, you need to be moving at 35 units/sec to start sliding.
For a 320-unit character, that's CRAWLING speed!

**FIX:** Set to **105** (3x scale = natural running speed)

### **3. MAX SPEED TOO LOW!**
If `slideMaxSpeed = 1680`, you'll hit the ceiling instantly and feel sluggish.

**FIX:** Set to **5040** (3x scale = exhilarating speed)

### **4. GRAVITY TOO WEAK!**
If `slideGravityAccel = 1080`, you won't accelerate fast enough on slopes.

**FIX:** Set to **3240** (3x scale = proper downhill rush)

## üéÆ QUICK TEST CHECKLIST:

1. **Open Unity Inspector** on your Player GameObject
2. **Find CleanAAACrouch component**
3. **Copy the values above EXACTLY**
4. **Test on a slope** (15-30 degrees)
5. **Press Ctrl** while moving - should start sliding immediately
6. **Feel the momentum build** as you go downhill
7. **Jump during slide** - momentum should carry through air
8. **Land while holding Ctrl** - slide should resume!

## üö® COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

‚ùå **DON'T** use the default values (they're for tiny characters!)
‚ùå **DON'T** set ground check distance < 2x your character height
‚ùå **DON'T** set min start speed < your normal walk speed
‚ùå **DON'T** forget to scale ALL distance-based values by 3x

‚úÖ **DO** scale all distance/speed values by 3x
‚úÖ **DO** keep time-based values unchanged
‚úÖ **DO** keep percentage values (0-1) unchanged
‚úÖ **DO** test on slopes first (easier to start sliding)

## üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:

- **On flat ground:** Press Ctrl while sprinting ‚Üí smooth slide with gradual slowdown
- **On slopes (12-50¬∞):** Press Ctrl ‚Üí instant slide, speed builds naturally
- **On steep slopes (>50¬∞):** Auto-slide even without Ctrl (wall jump integrity)
- **Jump during slide:** Momentum carries through air, resume on landing
- **Slope-to-flat transition:** Smooth deceleration with enhanced friction

## üîß IF STILL BROKEN AFTER THIS:

Check these potential code issues:

1. **Is `enableSlide` = true?**
2. **Is `movement` reference assigned?**
3. **Is `controller` (CharacterController) assigned?**
4. **Is ground layer mask correct?**
5. **Are you on Walking mode (not Flying)?**

## üí° PRO TIP - MOMENTUM COMPOUNDING:

The system has a **20% momentum GAIN per frame** on slopes!
```csharp
// Line 973: On slopes: 0.96 * 1.25 = 1.2 (20% GAIN!)
float preserveFactor = onSlope ? momentumPreservation * 1.25f : momentumPreservation;
```

This means the longer you slide downhill, the FASTER you go (up to max speed).
This is INTENTIONAL for flow state gameplay!

## üé™ ADVANCED: WALL SLIDING

If you want smooth wall collision during slides:
```
enableSmoothWallSliding = true (KEEP)
wallSlideSpeedPreservation = 0.95 (KEEP - 95% speed when hitting walls!)
wallSlideMinAngle = 45 (KEEP)
```

This prevents jarring stops when you clip geometry!
