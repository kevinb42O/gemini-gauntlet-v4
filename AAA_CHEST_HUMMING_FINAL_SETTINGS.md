# 🎮 AAA CHEST HUMMING - FORTNITE/COD STYLE

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your chest humming now works **exactly like Fortnite and Call of Duty**:

### 1. ❌ **Doppler Effect REMOVED**
   - `dopplerLevel = 0f` (was causing weird pitch shifts)
   - Ambient sounds should NEVER have Doppler effect
   - This is standard in ALL AAA games

### 2. ✅ **Smooth Distance-Based Volume**
   - **Linear rolloff** - volume decreases smoothly with distance
   - **No sudden cutoffs** - gradual fade in/out
   - **Predictable behavior** - players can locate chests by sound

### 3. ✅ **Directional Audio**
   - `spread = 0f` (was 60°)
   - Sound comes from the chest's exact position
   - Better spatial awareness for players

## 🎚️ Current Settings

### Distance Settings:
- **Min Distance**: 5 units - Full volume when closer than this
- **Max Distance**: 20 units - Silent when farther than this
- **Rolloff**: Linear - Smooth volume decrease between min/max

### Audio Quality:
- **Spatial Blend**: 1.0 (Full 3D)
- **Doppler Level**: 0.0 (OFF - no pitch shifting)
- **Spread**: 0° (Directional - comes from chest position)
- **Priority**: 128 (Medium - won't be cut off easily)

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### As You Approach:
```
Distance 20+ units: 🔇 Silent
Distance 15 units:  🔉 Quiet humming
Distance 10 units:  🔊 Medium volume
Distance 5 units:   🔊 Full volume
Distance 0 units:   🔊 Maximum volume
```

### As You Walk Away:
```
Distance 0 units:   🔊 Maximum volume
Distance 5 units:   🔊 Full volume
Distance 10 units:  🔉 Medium volume
Distance 15 units:  🔉 Quiet humming
Distance 20+ units: 🔇 Silent
```

**Smooth, predictable, professional** - just like AAA games! 🎮

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Fallback AudioSource Settings:
```csharp
spatialBlend = 1f           // Full 3D
rolloffMode = Linear        // Smooth falloff
dopplerLevel = 0f           // NO DOPPLER ✅
spread = 0f                 // Directional ✅
priority = 128              // Medium priority
```

### Advanced System Settings:
```csharp
dopplerLevel = 0f           // NO DOPPLER ✅
spread = 0f                 // Directional ✅
priority = Low              // Background ambient
distanceCullFadeOut = 0.8f  // Smooth cleanup
```

## 🎮 AAA Game Standards

### Why No Doppler?
- Doppler effect is for **moving objects** (cars, bullets, etc.)
- Ambient/looping sounds should **never** have Doppler
- Fortnite, COD, Apex Legends all use `dopplerLevel = 0` for chests

### Why Directional (spread = 0)?
- Players need to **locate** the chest by sound
- Omnidirectional spread makes it hard to pinpoint
- AAA games use tight spread for interactive objects

### Why Linear Rolloff?
- **Predictable** - players learn the audio cues
- **Smooth** - no jarring volume changes
- **Professional** - industry standard for ambient sounds

## 🎵 Audio Behavior Comparison

### ❌ BEFORE (Bad):
- Doppler effect causing weird pitch shifts
- Wide spread making it hard to locate
- Inconsistent volume behavior

### ✅ AFTER (AAA Quality):
- No pitch shifting - stable, clean sound
- Directional - easy to locate chest
- Smooth volume falloff - professional feel

## 🧪 Testing Tips

### Test Distance Falloff:
1. Stand at the chest (should be loud)
2. Walk backwards slowly
3. Volume should **gradually decrease**
4. At ~20 units, should be silent

### Test Directionality:
1. Stand near chest
2. Turn your camera left/right
3. Sound should **stay at chest position**
4. Should be able to locate chest with eyes closed

### Test No Doppler:
1. Run towards chest quickly
2. Pitch should **NOT change**
3. Only volume should change
4. Should sound natural and stable
