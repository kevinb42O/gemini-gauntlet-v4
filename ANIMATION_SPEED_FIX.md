# üîß **ANIMATION SPEED FIX - RIGHT HAND SPRINT TOO FAST**

## üö® **Problem:**
Right hand sprint animation playing at 2x speed (or faster) while left hand is normal speed.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Force Speed on Start:**
```csharp
void Start()
{
    if (handAnimator != null)
    {
        handAnimator.speed = 1.0f;
        Debug.Log($"[IndividualLayeredHandController] {name} FORCED animation speed to 1.0 on Start()");
    }
}
```

### **2. Enforce Speed Every Frame:**
```csharp
void Update()
{
    UpdateLayerWeights();
    
    // CRITICAL FIX: Continuously enforce animation speed = 1.0 every frame!
    if (handAnimator != null && handAnimator.speed != 1.0f)
    {
        handAnimator.speed = 1.0f;
        Debug.LogWarning($"[IndividualLayeredHandController] {name} animation speed was {handAnimator.speed}, forcing back to 1.0!");
    }
}
```

### **3. Lock Speed in SetAnimationSpeed():**
```csharp
public void SetAnimationSpeed(float speed)
{
    if (handAnimator != null)
    {
        // FORCE speed to 1.0 to prevent animation speed issues
        handAnimator.speed = 1.0f;
        
        if (enableDebugLogs)
            Debug.Log($"[IndividualLayeredHandController] {name} animation speed LOCKED to 1.0 (requested: {speed})");
    }
}
```

## üîç **What To Check:**

### **In Unity Editor:**
1. Select the **Right Hand** GameObject
2. Look at the **Animator** component
3. Check the **Speed** parameter (should be 1.0)
4. Play the game and watch if it changes

### **In Console Logs:**
Look for these messages:
```
[IndividualLayeredHandController] RobotArmII_R FORCED animation speed to 1.0 on Start()
```

If you see this warning:
```
[IndividualLayeredHandController] RobotArmII_R animation speed was 2.0, forcing back to 1.0!
```

This means **something else is changing the speed** - we need to find what!

---

## üéØ **Possible Causes:**

1. **Another script** is setting animator.speed
2. **Unity Animator Controller** has speed multiplier on states
3. **Animation clips** themselves have speed settings
4. **Time.timeScale** is affecting animations differently

---

## üîß **Additional Checks:**

### **Check Animation Clip Speed:**
1. In Unity, find your **Sprint animation clip**
2. Select it in Project window
3. Look at Inspector
4. Check if there's a **Speed** multiplier (should be 1.0)

### **Check Animator State Speed:**
1. Open the **Animator** window
2. Click on the **L_run** (sprint) state
3. Look at Inspector
4. Check **Speed** parameter (should be 1.0)

### **Check Both Hands:**
Make sure BOTH left and right hand animators have:
- Same animation clips assigned
- Same state speeds
- Same transition settings

---

## ‚úÖ **Expected Result:**
Both hands should run at **exactly the same speed** - smooth, synchronized animations!

If right hand is STILL too fast after this fix, there's something in the Unity Animator setup that's different between left and right hands!
