# ðŸŽ¯ JUMP ANIMATION FIX - COMPLETE

## Root Cause Identified

**The Problem:** Script execution order race condition

```
Frame N:
1. PlayerAnimationStateManager.Update() runs FIRST
2. Auto-detection checks states and sees Sprint/Walk
3. Changes animation to Sprint/Walk
4. AAAMovementController.Update() runs SECOND
5. Detects jump and sets state to Jump
6. But auto-detection already ran this frame!

Result: Jump animation gets set for 1 frame, then immediately overridden by auto-detection on the next frame
```

## Solutions Applied

### 1. âœ… Moved Auto-Detection to LateUpdate()
**File:** `PlayerAnimationStateManager.cs`

```csharp
void Update()
{
    // Only handle emote input (responsive)
    HandleEmoteInput();
}

void LateUpdate()
{
    // Auto-detection runs AFTER all other scripts' Update()
    UpdateMovementState();
    UpdateActionStates();
    CleanupExpiredCooldowns();
}
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Manual triggers (Jump, Land, Slide, Dive) happen in other scripts' `Update()`
- Auto-detection now runs in `LateUpdate()`, **AFTER** all manual triggers
- One-shot locks are set **BEFORE** auto-detection checks them
- No more race conditions!

### 2. âœ… Increased Jump Animation Duration
- **From:** 0.3 seconds â†’ **To:** 0.6 seconds
- Ensures full animation plays even with minor timing variations
- Matches typical jump arc timing

### 3. âœ… Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added ðŸ”’ lock indicators
- Shows exact time remaining on one-shot protection
- Clear visibility when protection starts/ends

### 4. âœ… One-Shot Animation Protection System
Already in place from Land animation fix:
```csharp
if (isPlayingOneShotAnimation && Time.time < oneShotAnimationEndTime)
{
    LogDebug($"[ONE-SHOT PROTECTION] Blocking auto-detection");
    return; // Auto-detection blocked
}
```

### 5. âœ… Manual State Override Tracking
For Slide/Dive to prevent dual control issues:
```csharp
if (slideManuallyTriggered || diveManuallyTriggered)
{
    // Skip auto-detection for these states
}
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### Jump Animation Flow:
```
1. Player presses Space
2. AAAMovementController.Update() detects jump
3. Calls SetMovementState(Jump) 
4. Jump lock set: oneShotAnimationEndTime = Time.time + 0.6
5. PlayerAnimationStateManager.LateUpdate() runs
6. Sees one-shot lock active, blocks auto-detection
7. Jump animation plays for full 0.6 seconds
8. Lock expires, auto-detection resumes
9. Transitions to appropriate state (Walk/Sprint/Idle)
```

### Land Animation Flow:
```
1. AAAMovementController.CheckGrounded() detects landing
2. Calls SetMovementState(Land)
3. Land lock set: oneShotAnimationEndTime = Time.time + 0.5
4. PlayerAnimationStateManager.LateUpdate() runs
5. Sees one-shot lock active, blocks auto-detection
6. Land animation plays for full 0.5 seconds
7. Lock expires, auto-detection resumes
8. Transitions to appropriate state (Walk/Sprint/Idle)
```

## Testing Results Expected

### âœ… Jump Animation (from Idle)
- Animation plays 100% of the time
- Full 0.6 second duration
- Smooth transition after completion

### âœ… Jump Animation (from Sprint)
- Animation plays 100% of the time
- Not interrupted by Sprint auto-detection
- Returns to Sprint after landing (if still holding Shift)

### âœ… Land Animation
- Already working 80% â†’ should now be 100%
- Full 0.5 second duration
- Matches land sound timing perfectly

### âœ… Slide/Dive Animations
- No auto-detection interference
- Manual start/stop only
- Clean state transitions

## Architecture Benefits

**Single Source of Truth Principle:**
- Each animation has ONE authoritative trigger point
- Auto-detection respects manual triggers
- No fighting systems

**Execution Order Hierarchy:**
```
Update():
  - Other scripts make decisions (Jump, Land, Slide, Dive)
  - Manual triggers set states
  - One-shot locks activated

LateUpdate():
  - Auto-detection checks states
  - Respects one-shot locks
  - Respects manual override flags
  - Only updates when appropriate
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Script execution order matters** - Auto-detection must run AFTER manual triggers
2. **LateUpdate() is for coordination** - Perfect for systems that need to respect other scripts' decisions
3. **Locks prevent override** - One-shot animations need protection from auto-detection
4. **Manual flags prevent dual control** - Slide/Dive shouldn't be both manually triggered AND auto-detected

## Files Modified

1. `PlayerAnimationStateManager.cs`
   - Moved auto-detection to LateUpdate()
   - Increased jump duration to 0.6s
   - Enhanced debug logging
   - Added manual state override tracking

## Status

ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE** - All animation corruption from auto-detection should now be resolved!

The system now follows a clear hierarchy:
- Manual triggers are KING (Update)
- Auto-detection is SERVANT (LateUpdate)
- One-shot locks are ABSOLUTE (until duration expires)

Test with the scenarios in `JUMP_ANIMATION_DEBUG.md` and report results!
