# 🔥 FIX: "No visuals assigned for Primary hand!"

## The Problem

You're getting this error:
```
PlayerOverheatManager: No visuals assigned for Primary hand!
```

Even though your `HandOverheatVisuals` component looks correctly configured.

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

The `HandOverheatVisuals` component is **disabling itself** during `Awake()` because validation is failing!

When the component disables itself:
1. `Awake()` runs → validation fails → `enabled = false`
2. `Start()` never runs (because component is disabled)
3. Component never registers with `PlayerOverheatManager`
4. Result: "No visuals assigned" error

---

## 🔍 What to Check

### In Your Console, Look for These Errors:

**Error 1: Missing Prefab**
```
❌ HandOverheatVisuals: Wildfire Leading Edge Prefab not assigned!
```
**Fix:** Assign a prefab to "Wildfire Leading Edge Prefab" field

---

**Error 2: Missing Path Points**
```
❌ HandOverheatVisuals: Path Points array requires at least 2 points. Found 0.
```
**Fix:** Set Path Points array size to at least 2

---

**Error 3: NULL Path Point (MOST COMMON)**
```
❌ HandOverheatVisuals: Path Point at index 0 is NULL!
```
**Fix:** One of your path point slots is empty - assign a transform!

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Check Console for Errors

When you enter Play Mode, look for **red error messages** that say:
- `"Wildfire Leading Edge Prefab not assigned"`
- `"Path Points array requires at least 2 points"`
- `"Path Point at index X is NULL"`

### 2. Fix the LEFT Hand Component

Select your LEFT hand GameObject and check `HandOverheatVisuals`:

#### ✅ Wildfire Leading Edge Prefab
- Must be assigned (not "None")
- You have `FireMeshGlow` - that's good ✅

#### ✅ Wildfire Trail Segment Prefab
- Must be assigned (not "None")
- You have `FireMeshGlow` - that's good ✅

#### ✅ Path Points (CRITICAL!)
You have 4 elements - **ALL 4 MUST BE ASSIGNED!**

Check each one:
```
Element 0: ⚠️ Must have a Transform assigned (not "None")
Element 1: ⚠️ Must have a Transform assigned (not "None")
Element 2: ⚠️ Must have a Transform assigned (not "None")
Element 3: ⚠️ Must have a Transform assigned (not "None")
```

**If ANY element shows "None" → That's your problem!**

## 🎯 Quick Fix Checklist

```
☐ Enter Play Mode
☐ Check Console for red errors about HandOverheatVisuals
☐ If you see "Path Point at index X is NULL":
   ☐ Exit Play Mode
   ☐ Select LEFT hand GameObject
   ☐ Find HandOverheatVisuals component
   ☐ Expand "Path Points" array
   ☐ Find the empty slot (shows "None")
   ☐ Drag a transform into it (hand bone, forearm, etc.)
   ☐ Save scene
   ☐ Enter Play Mode again
☐ Error should be gone!
```

## 🎮 What Path Points Should Be

Path points define where the fire effect travels:

**Typical setup:**
```
Element 0: Hand bone/transform (where fingers are)
Element 1: Wrist or lower forearm
Element 2: Mid forearm or elbow
Element 3: Upper arm or shoulder
```

The fire will spread from Element 0 → Element 3 as heat increases.

---

## 🔍 Use the Diagnostic Tool

If you're still stuck:

1. Add `HandOverheatDiagnostic` component to your player
2. Enter Play Mode
3. Right-click component → "Run Hand Overheat Diagnostic"
4. Check Console - it will tell you if component is disabled

---

## 💡 TL;DR

**Your component is disabling itself because one or more Path Points are NULL (empty).**

**Fix:**
1. Check Console for error about "Path Point at index X is NULL"
2. Go to that index in the Path Points array
3. Assign a transform
4. Done!

*The component configuration looks correct, but validation is failing during Awake(). Check those path points!* 🔥
