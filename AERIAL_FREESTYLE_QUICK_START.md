## 🎨 OPTIONAL: ADD UI (5 Minutes)

### Quick UI Setup:

1. **Create UI Canvas** (if needed):
   - GameObject → UI → Canvas
   - Canvas Scaler: "Scale With Screen Size"

2. **Create Panel**:
   - Right-click Canvas → UI → Panel
   - Name: "TrickUIPanel"
   - Anchor: Top-Right
   - Background: Semi-transparent

3. **Add 3 Text Elements** (children of panel):
   - "RotationText" - Shows flip counts
   - "TrickNameText" - Shows trick name
   - "LandingFeedbackText" - Shows landing quality

4. **Add Script**:
   - Add `AerialFreestyleTrickUI` component to Canvas
   - Assign the 3 text references
   - Done!

**Or skip UI entirely** - the system works perfectly without it!

## 🚀 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Jump and hold LEFT ALT - freestyle activates
- [ ] Move mouse up - camera pitches backward (backflip)
- [ ] Move mouse down - camera pitches forward (frontflip)
- [ ] Move mouse left/right - camera spins
- [ ] Release ALT in air - smooth exit
- [ ] Land while flipping - reconciliation effect

### Advanced Tricks:
- [ ] Diagonal mouse movement - varial flips
- [ ] Complete 360° rotation - full backflip
- [ ] Land upright - clean landing (minimal shake)
- [ ] Land inverted - crash landing (heavy shake)
- [ ] FOV increases during tricks
- [ ] Console logs show rotation stats

### 🔥 NEW: Skate-Style Features:
- [ ] Initial burst on activation (⚡ BURST! in UI)
- [ ] Fast mouse movement = fast rotation
- [ ] Slow mouse movement = slow rotation
- [ ] Stop mouse = rotation gradually stops
- [ ] Resume mouse = rotation resumes
- [ ] Speed bar shows current rotation speed

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Can't activate on ground
- [ ] Can't activate immediately after jump (0.15s delay)
- [ ] Works with wall jumps
- [ ] Works with double jumps
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with normal camera

## 💡 QUICK TIPS

### Getting Started:
1. **Start simple** - just do a single backflip
2. **Hold ALT longer** - more time = more rotations
3. **Release ALT early** - practice smooth exits
4. **Land clean** - aim for upright landings first

### Advanced Techniques:
1. **Cork Screw** - circular mouse motion (flip + spin)
2. **Varial Flip** - diagonal mouse (flip + roll)
3. **Recovery** - release ALT to abort mid-trick
4. **Perfect Landing** - complete exactly 360° rotation

### 🔥 NEW: Skate-Style Techniques:
1. **The Speed Pump** - pulse mouse movement for rhythm
2. **The Stall** - stop mouse to hang inverted
3. **The Precision Landing** - slow down as you approach upright
4. **The Speed Burst** - alternate slow/fast for dynamic tricks

### Tuning:
- **Too slow?** → Increase rotation speed & sensitivity
- **Too fast?** → Decrease rotation speed & sensitivity
- **Too jerky?** → Increase smoothing
- **Too floaty?** → Decrease smoothing
- **Snap too harsh?** → Decrease reconciliation speed

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES

**"Nothing happens when I press LEFT ALT"**
- Make sure you're airborne
- Wait 0.15s after jumping
- Check `enableAerialFreestyle` is enabled

**"Camera rotates but feels wrong"**
- Adjust `trickInputSensitivity` (try 4-5)
- Adjust `trickRotationSmoothing` (try 0.1-0.2)
- Check your mouse sensitivity isn't too low

**"Landing snap is too violent"**
- Decrease `landingReconciliationSpeed` to 15-20
- Increase `cleanLandingThreshold` to 35-45°

**"Can't complete full rotations"**
- Jump higher (use double jump or wall jump)
- Increase `maxTrickRotationSpeed` to 540-720°/s
- Move mouse faster

---

## 🎬 WHAT TO EXPECT

### Visual Effects:
- ✅ **FOV boost** during tricks (wider view)
- ✅ **Smooth rotation** in all directions
- ✅ **Camera shake** on crash landings
- ✅ **Trauma effect** scales with rotation

### Console Feedback:
```
🎪 [FREESTYLE] TRICK MODE ACTIVATED! Camera is now independent!
✨ [FREESTYLE] CLEAN LANDING! Deviation: 18.3° - Smooth recovery
🎪 [FREESTYLE] LANDED - Total flips: X=1.2 Y=0.3 Z=0.1
```

### Gameplay Feel:
- **Disorienting** when inverted (intentional!)
- **Exhilarating** during rotation
- **Satisfying** on clean landing
- **Visceral** on crash landing

## 📊 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test the basics** - Get comfortable with simple flips
2. **Tune to taste** - Adjust Inspector values
3. **Add UI** (optional) - For visual feedback
4. **Show your friends** - Watch them be amazed
5. **Make a trailer** - This WILL sell your game
