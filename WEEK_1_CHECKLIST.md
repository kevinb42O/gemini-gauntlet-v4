## üìÖ DAY 1-2: TUTORIAL PLATFORM (6-8 hours)

### Monday Morning: Setup
- [ ] Open Unity project
- [ ] Create new scene: `Assets/Scenes/TutorialPlatform.unity`
- [ ] Save it

### Monday Afternoon: Build the Platform
- [ ] Create empty GameObject: "TutorialPlatform"
- [ ] Add a large plane/cube (Scale: 50x1x50) - this is your platform
- [ ] Add material with emission (make it glow slightly)
- [ ] Position at world origin (0, 0, 0)

### Monday Evening: Add Player Spawn
- [ ] Find your Player prefab (probably in `Assets/prefabs_made/`)
- [ ] Drag into scene at position (0, 2, 0) - above platform
- [ ] Test: Press Play - can you move/jump?
- [ ] ‚úÖ **CHECKPOINT**: "I can control the player"

### Tuesday Morning: Tutorial Prompts
You need to create simple UI text that teaches controls.

**Option A: Quick & Dirty (15 minutes)**
- [ ] Create Canvas (UI ‚Üí Canvas)
- [ ] Add Text (UI ‚Üí Legacy ‚Üí Text)
- [ ] Position in center of screen
- [ ] Text: "WASD = Move | SPACE = Jump | SHIFT = Sprint | CTRL = Slide"
- [ ] Make text BIG (Font size: 24)

**Option B: Proper Tutorial (1 hour)** - Use existing UI
- [ ] Find `UIManager` in your project
- [ ] Check if you have a tutorial panel already
- [ ] If yes: Enable it, set text
- [ ] If no: Use Option A

### Tuesday Afternoon: Add Enemies
- [ ] Find `SkullEnemy` prefab
- [ ] Drag 3 into scene, spread them out
- [ ] Test: Do they attack you when close?
- [ ] ‚úÖ **CHECKPOINT**: "I can shoot enemies"

---

## üìÖ DAY 3-4: PLATFORMS 2-5 (6-8 hours)

### Wednesday: Duplicate + Scale
- [ ] In Scene Hierarchy, duplicate TutorialPlatform (Ctrl+D)
- [ ] Rename to "Platform_02"
- [ ] Move it vertically: Y = +30 (above tutorial platform)
- [ ] Add 5 enemies (SkullEnemy)
- [ ] Add 1 chest
- [ ] Add 1 elevator

**REPEAT THIS 3 MORE TIMES** (Platforms 3, 4, 5)
- Platform_03: 8 enemies, 2 chests
- Platform_04: 10 enemies, 1 chest, 1 TowerController
- Platform_05: 1 GuardianEnemy (boss), 1 chest

**Pro Tip**: Stack them vertically (Y = 0, 30, 60, 90, 120)

### Thursday: Connect Elevators
- [ ] Open `ElevatorController.cs`
- [ ] Check: Does it have "nextSceneName" or "nextPlatform" variable?

- [ ] Test: Can you ride elevator from Platform 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3?
- [ ] ‚úÖ **CHECKPOINT**: "5 platforms exist and are connected"

## üìÖ DAY 5: DEATH & MENU LOOP (4-5 hours)

### Friday Morning: Death Screen
- [ ] When player health hits 0, does `PlayerHealth.cs` trigger something?
- [ ] Check if `XPSummaryUI.cs` already exists (IT DOES!)
- [ ] Find the prefab/canvas for XP summary
- [ ] Test: Die intentionally - do you see a stats screen?

**If stats screen exists:**
- [ ] Make sure it shows: Platforms survived, enemies killed, gems collected
- [ ] Add button: "Return to Menu" ‚Üí loads main menu scene

**If stats screen doesn't exist (Quick Fix):**
```csharp
// Add to PlayerHealth.cs in OnDeath():
Debug.Log("YOU DIED! Platforms: " + platformsCleared + " Kills: " + enemiesKilled);
// Load menu scene:
SceneManager.LoadScene("MainMenu");
```

### Friday Afternoon: Menu Flow
- [ ] Open your main menu scene
- [ ] Find "Start Game" button
- [ ] Make sure it loads TutorialPlatform scene
- [ ] Test FULL LOOP:
  1. Boot game
  2. Click "Start"
  3. Play through platforms
  4. Die
  5. See stats
  6. Return to menu
- [ ] ‚úÖ **CHECKPOINT**: "Complete loop works!"

## üí° **PROTIPS FOR STAYING MOTIVATED**

### Start Each Day With:
1. Open Unity
2. Press Play
3. Wall-run for 30 seconds
4. Remember why you built this
5. Pick ONE checkbox from today's list
6. Do that. Celebrate. Next checkbox.

### End Each Day With:
1. Save scene (Ctrl+S)
2. Git commit (or just Save Project)
3. Write down ONE thing that worked today
4. Example: "Enemies spawn and attack!"
5. That's a win. Tomorrow you build on it.

### When You Want to Quit:
Remember: You already built the HARD parts (movement, shooting, AI).  
This week is just stitching them together.  
You're not building new systems.  
You're arranging furniture in a house you already constructed.
