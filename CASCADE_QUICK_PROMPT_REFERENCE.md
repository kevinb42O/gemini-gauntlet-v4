## üéØ KEY PHRASES TO USE

### For Focused Analysis:
- "Focus ONLY on HIGH/CRITICAL issues"
- "Ignore MEDIUM/LOW priority for now"
- "Start with the #1 highest impact issue"

### For Specific Fixes:
- "Show me exact code with line numbers"
- "Provide before/after code snippets"
- "Give me immediately runnable code"

### For Verification:
- "What values should change?"
- "How do I verify this worked?"
- "What should I see in the next report?"

### For Efficiency:
- "Keep explanations concise"
- "I'll ask follow-ups if needed"
- "Just the facts, no fluff"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID THESE PHRASES

‚ùå "Make it better" (too vague)
‚ùå "Optimize everything" (too broad)
‚ùå "What's wrong?" (attach AI report first!)
‚ùå "Fix all issues" (prioritize instead)

## üìä EXPECTED AI RESPONSE FORMAT

**Good Response Includes:**
```
1. PRIORITY ASSESSMENT
   - #1 Issue: [Specific issue]
   - Impact: [X/10]
   - Affected Component: [ScriptName]

2. ROOT CAUSE
   - [2-3 sentence explanation]
   - Evidence: [Reference to log values]

3. CODE FIX
   Before:
   [code snippet]
   
   After:
   [code snippet]
   
   Explanation: [What this does]

4. VERIFICATION

## üî• POWER USER TIPS

### Tip 1: Chain Prompts
```
First prompt: "What's the #1 issue?"
Second prompt: "Show me the fix for that"
Third prompt: "Any side effects to watch for?"
```

### Tip 2: Reference Previous Fixes
```
"You previously suggested [X]. I implemented it. 
Now the AI report shows [Y]. Is this expected?"
```

### Tip 3: Ask for Alternatives
```
"You suggested [solution A]. 
Is there a simpler alternative that's 80% as effective?"
```

### Tip 4: Request Explanations
```
"I don't understand why [X] causes [Y].
