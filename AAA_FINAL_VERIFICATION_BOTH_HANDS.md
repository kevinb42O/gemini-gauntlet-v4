# ✅ FINAL VERIFICATION - BOTH HANDS PERFECT ✅

## CONFIRMED: RIGHT HAND NOW WORKS! 

You were correct - the **RIGHT hand (Secondary/RMB)** wasn't working after removing `PlayerSecondHandAbility.cs`.  
**LEFT hand (Primary/LMB)** was already working fine.

---

## 🎯 HAND MAPPING - 100% CONSISTENT EVERYWHERE

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  LMB (Left Click)  →  LEFT HAND   →  isPrimary=TRUE  ║
║  RMB (Right Click) →  RIGHT HAND  →  isPrimary=FALSE ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

This mapping is now **perfectly consistent** across your entire codebase!
