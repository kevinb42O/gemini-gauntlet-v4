   - Position: `(0, 100, 0)` ← Adjust to your tower height!
3. **Create Bottom Floor Marker:**
   - Right-click `TowerElevatorSystem` → Create Empty → Name: `BottomFloorPosition`
   - Position: `(0, 0, 0)` ← Ground level

---

### **STEP 2: Create the Elevator Car**

1. **Create the elevator car:**
   - Right-click `TowerElevatorSystem` → 3D Object → Cube → Name: `ElevatorCar`
   - Scale: `(4, 3, 4)` ← Adjust to fit your needs
   - Position: `(0, 100, 0)` ← Starts at top floor

2. **Add colliders to prevent falling through:**
   - **Floor:** Duplicate the cube, scale Y to `0.1`, position at bottom of car
   - **Walls:** Create 4 thin cubes around the edges (optional for extra safety)
   - **Ceiling:** Duplicate cube, scale Y to `0.1`, position at top (optional)

3. **Create Player Detection Zone:**
   - Right-click `ElevatorCar` → Create Empty → Name: `PlayerDetectionZone`
   - Position: `(0, 0, 0)` ← Center of elevator car
   - This will be used to detect when player enters/exits

4. **Add ElevatorController script:**
   - Select `ElevatorCar`
   - Add Component → `ElevatorController`
   - **Configure in Inspector:**
     - **Top Floor Position:** Drag `TopFloorPosition` here
     - **Bottom Floor Position:** Drag `BottomFloorPosition` here
     - **Elevator Car:** Drag `ElevatorCar` here (or leave auto-assigned)
     - **Player Detection Zone:** Drag `PlayerDetectionZone` here
     - **Player Layer:** Set to layer with player (usually "Default" or custom "Player" layer)
     - **Detection Radius:** `3` ← Covers the elevator interior
     - **Max Speed:** `50` ← SUPER FAST! Adjust to taste
     - **Acceleration Time:** `2` ← Time to reach max speed
     - **Deceleration Time:** `2` ← Time to slow down

### **STEP 3: Create INSIDE Button (Smart Single Button!)** ⚡

**NEW SYSTEM:** One button inside elevator that adapts based on current floor!

1. **Create button panel inside elevator:**
   - Right-click `ElevatorCar` → 3D Object → Cube → Name: `ButtonPanel`
   - Position: `(0, 1, 1.5)` ← Inside elevator, on wall
   - Scale: `(0.3, 0.3, 0.1)` ← Button-sized
   - Rotation: Face the player when inside

2. **Add smart script:**
   - Add Component → `ElevatorButtonPanel`
   - **Configure:**
     - **Elevator Controller:** Drag `ElevatorCar` here
     - **Interaction Range:** `3`
     - **Player Layer:** Set to player layer
     - **Button Renderer:** Drag the button's MeshRenderer here

   - Canvas settings: **World Space**
   - Rect Transform: Scale `(0.01, 0.01, 0.01)`
   - Add → UI → Text - TextMeshPro → Name: `InteractionText`
   - Drag canvas to `UI Canvas` field in ElevatorButtonPanel
   - Drag text to `Interaction Text` field

4. **Optional: Add Audio:**
   - Add `AudioSource` component to `ButtonPanel`
   - Assign button press sound clips

**🎮 HOW IT WORKS:**
- **At bottom floor** → Button says "Go to TOP floor ⬆️"
- **At top floor** → Button says "Go to BOTTOM floor ⬇️"
- **While moving** → Button says "Elevator moving... (spam me! 😄)"
  - **Spam clicking plays sound each time** (fun feature!)
  - **Doesn't affect elevator** (just satisfying clicks!)

#### **Bottom Floor Button:**

1. **Create button object:**
   - Create → 3D Object → Cube → Name: `BottomCallButton`
   - Position: `(0, 1, 5)` ← Near bottom floor
   - Scale: `(0.5, 0.5, 0.2)` ← Button-sized

2. **Add interaction script:**
   - Add Component → `ElevatorCallButton`
   - **Configure:**
     - **Elevator Controller:** Drag `ElevatorCar` here
     - **Is Bottom Floor Button:** ✅ **Checked**
     - **Interaction Range:** `3`
     - **Player Layer:** Set to player layer

### **STEP 4: (Optional) Integrate Existing ElevatorDoor System** 🚪

If you have the **ElevatorDoor** sliding door system, you can integrate it!

1. **Setup doors at both floors:**
   - Place your `ElevatorDoor` GameObjects at top and bottom floors
   - Configure left/right door references as normal
   - Make sure doors align with elevator entrance

2. **Link doors to button panel:**
   - Select your `ButtonPanel` (inside elevator)
   - Check **Use Doors** checkbox
   - Drag top floor `ElevatorDoor` to **Top Floor Doors**
   - Drag bottom floor `ElevatorDoor` to **Bottom Floor Doors**

3. **Automatic behavior:**
   - When button pressed, doors close automatically
   - Doors open when elevator arrives (if configured in ElevatorDoor)
   - Creates seamless elevator + door experience!

**🎯 Result:**
- Press button → Doors close → Elevator moves → Doors open at destination!

## ⚙️ ADVANCED CONFIGURATION

### **Speed Tuning:**

```
Max Speed = 150   ← NEW DEFAULT (SUPER FAST!) ⚡
Max Speed = 250   ← INSANELY FAST!! 🚀
Max Speed = 500   ← LUDICROUS SPEED!!! 💥
Max Speed = 100   ← Moderate fast
Max Speed = 50    ← Moderate speed
Max Speed = 25    ← Slow/cinematic
```

### **Acceleration Curves (EXPONENTIAL EASING!):**

The system uses **quadratic easing** for buttery-smooth feel:
- **Ease-In (Acceleration)**: Starts slow, accelerates exponentially (t²)
- **Ease-Out (Deceleration)**: Decelerates smoothly to perfect stop

```
Acceleration Time = 1.5s  ← NEW DEFAULT (snappy start!)
Acceleration Time = 0.5s  ← Sudden burst
Acceleration Time = 2.5s  ← Gradual build-up

Deceleration Time = 2.5s  ← NEW DEFAULT (smooth landing!)
Deceleration Time = 1.5s  ← Quick stop
Deceleration Time = 4.0s  ← Ultra-smooth arrival
```

### **Physics Safety:**

The system uses `CharacterController.Move()` to move the player with the elevator, which is physics-safe and prevents falling through. Make sure:
- Player has `CharacterController` component
- Player is on the correct layer (`playerLayer` in ElevatorController)
- Detection radius covers the entire elevator interior

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Player falls through elevator:**
- ✅ Ensure elevator car has proper colliders
- ✅ Check player layer is set correctly in ElevatorController
- ✅ Increase detection radius if needed
- ✅ Make sure player has CharacterController component

### **Elevator too fast/slow:**
- Adjust `Max Speed` in ElevatorController (default: 50)
- Adjust `Acceleration Time` and `Deceleration Time`

### **Button doesn't work:**
- ✅ Check interaction range (default: 3)
- ✅ Ensure player is on correct layer
- ✅ Verify ElevatorController is assigned

### **Elevator doesn't move:**
- ✅ Check TopFloorPosition and BottomFloorPosition are assigned
- ✅ Ensure positions are different (Y-axis)
- ✅ Check console for error messages

## 📊 PERFORMANCE NOTES

- Uses efficient `CharacterController.Move()` for player movement
- Minimal physics calculations (uses kinematic movement)
- Smooth coroutine-based animation (no FixedUpdate spam)
- Only detects players when needed

---

## 🎯 CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS

1. **Multiple Floors:** Create intermediate stops with additional buttons
2. **Express Elevator:** Add "express to top" button that skips floors
3. **Capacity Limit:** Add max player count before elevator moves
4. **Emergency Stop:** Add button inside elevator to stop mid-journey
5. **Glass Elevator:** Use transparent materials to see outside while traveling
6. **Shaft Lighting:** Add lights that pass by as elevator moves
7. **Wind Effects:** Add particle effects for speed sensation

## 🔥 EXPONENTIAL EASING FORMULA

The system uses **quadratic easing curves** for that premium feel:

### **Acceleration Phase (Ease-In Quad):**
```
t = timeElapsed / accelerationTime  (normalized 0-1)
easedT = t²  (exponential curve)
currentSpeed = easedT * maxSpeed

Result: Starts VERY slow, then ramps up exponentially!
Think: Roller coaster slowly climbing, then WHOOSH!
```

### **Constant Speed Phase:**
```
currentSpeed = maxSpeed

Result: FULL THROTTLE! Maximum velocity sustained.
```

### **Deceleration Phase (Ease-Out Quad):**
```
t = timeElapsed / decelerationTime  (normalized 0-1)
easedT = 1 - ((1 - t)²)  (inverse exponential)
currentSpeed = (1 - easedT) * maxSpeed

Result: Smooth deceleration curve that feels natural!
Think: Feather-soft landing, no jarring stop.
```

### **Why This Feels Amazing:**
- **Ease-In**: Mimics real-world inertia (takes time to accelerate)
- **Ease-Out**: Smooth brake application (no sudden stops)
- **Exponential curves**: More satisfying than linear (our brains expect this!)
- **Perfect stop**: Floating point epsilon ensures completion

This ensures the elevator:
- **Starts smoothly** (exponential ramp-up)
- **Reaches max speed** quickly but naturally
- **Maintains velocity** at peak
- **Lands perfectly** (exponential slow-down)
- **Completes every time** (epsilon-based completion check)
