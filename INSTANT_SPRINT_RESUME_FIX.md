# ⚡ INSTANT SPRINT RESUME - FIXED!

## 🐛 Problem Identified

After landing from a jump while sprinting, there was a **delay** before sprint animation resumed, even though player was still holding Shift + W.

### Root Cause:
```
Player sprinting → Jumps → Lands → Holds Shift + W
                                        ↓
                    Land animation completes
                                        ↓
                    lastManualStateChangeTime still set from Land trigger
                                        ↓
                    MANUAL_STATE_OVERRIDE_DURATION (0.1s) blocks auto-detection
                                        ↓
                    Have to wait 0.1 seconds before Sprint can be detected again
                                        ↓
                    DELAY before Sprint resumes! ❌
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

When a one-shot animation (Jump/Land) completes, **immediately clear** the manual override timer:

```csharp
else if (isPlayingOneShotAnimation && Time.time >= oneShotAnimationEndTime)
{
    isPlayingOneShotAnimation = false;
    lastManualStateChangeTime = -999f; // INSTANT state resumption!
    // Fall through to immediately detect and apply correct state
}
```

### New Flow:
```
Player sprinting → Jumps → Lands → Holds Shift + W
                                        ↓
                    Land animation completes
                                        ↓
                    lastManualStateChangeTime = -999f (CLEARED!)
                                        ↓
                    Auto-detection runs IMMEDIATELY (same frame!)
                                        ↓
                    Detects Sprint condition (Shift + W + grounded)
                                        ↓
                    Sprint animation resumes INSTANTLY! ✅
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### Test: Jump While Sprinting
1. Hold **Shift + W** to sprint
2. Press **Space** to jump
3. Keep holding **Shift + W** while in air
4. Land on ground
5. **Sprint animation should resume INSTANTLY** (same frame as land completes)

### Console Logs You'll See:
```
🚀 [JUMP] ANIMATION TRIGGERED! Lock for 0.6s | Previous: Sprint
... jump plays for 0.6 seconds ...
✅ [ONE-SHOT] Animation completed - INSTANT auto-detection enabled
⚡ [INSTANT SPRINT] Sprint resumed INSTANTLY: Jump → Sprint
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before Fix:
- One-shot completion → Wait 0.1s → Auto-detection → Sprint resumes
- **Total delay: ~0.1 seconds** (noticeable!)

### After Fix:
- One-shot completion → Auto-detection runs same frame → Sprint resumes
- **Total delay: 0 seconds** (instant!)

### Why This Works:
Setting `lastManualStateChangeTime = -999f` makes the time check fail immediately:
```csharp
if (Time.time - (-999f) < 0.1f)  // This is FALSE (huge time difference)
{
    return; // Skip auto-detection
}
// Continue to auto-detection immediately!
```

## 🎮 Applies To:

This fix ensures **instant state resumption** after:
- ✅ **Jump → Sprint** (if still holding Shift + W)
- ✅ **Jump → Walk** (if only holding W)
- ✅ **Jump → Idle** (if no input)
- ✅ **Land → Sprint** (if still holding Shift + W)
- ✅ **Land → Walk** (if only holding W)
- ✅ **Land → Idle** (if no input)

**All transitions after one-shot animations are now INSTANT!**

## 📋 Files Modified

- `PlayerAnimationStateManager.cs`
  - Line 164: Clear manual override timer on one-shot completion
  - Line 189: Added instant sprint resume logging

## ✅ Status

**FIXED** - Sprint now resumes instantly after jump/land animations complete!

No more awkward delays between landing and sprint resuming. The system now responds in the **same frame** that the animation completes.
